<h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>


<p>It has often occurred to the Author that there are two
principal defects in the existing treatises on the game
of Whist&mdash;the one that the principles of play are, in
general, laid down as so many isolated and arbitrary
conventions, the reasons upon which such principles
are based being seldom, if at all, and scarcely ever
fully, stated; the other, that suitable illustrations, by
which alone the principles can be brought forcibly
home and fixed in the memory, are almost entirely
wanting. The present work is an attempt to supply
these deficiencies. With regard to the latter, the
Author feels that nothing, in point of illustration
of principles, can be so instructive as a selection of
hands played completely through, and accompanied
by copious explanations. The idea, it is believed, as
applied to Whist, is a new one, though a similar plan
has long been in use in treatises on Chess.</p>

<p>It has not been deemed necessary to occupy space
by detailing the mode of playing and of scoring, as
this information can be readily acquired at the table.
The reader is, therefore, credited with this elementary
knowledge, and is conducted at once to the General
Principles, which he is advised to consider carefully
before proceeding to the Hands.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>PREFACE TO THE SIXTEENTH EDITION.</h2>


<p>The attention of the Reader is particularly directed
to Appendix A, explanatory of American Leads. The
Author is firmly convinced that American Leads are
founded on true principles of whist play, and they
therefore have his hearty approval. But, he hesitates
to insist upon these leads in the body of the
"Principles," as they have not yet met with universal,&mdash;and,
perhaps, hardly with general,&mdash;acceptance.</p>

<p>The advanced player is also invited to consider,
with care, Appendix B, which treats briefly of The
Plain-Suit Echo.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE EIGHTEENTH EDITION.</h2>


<p>The advanced player is invited to consider, with
care, Appendix C, which treats of the leads from
ace, king, and from king, queen suits.</p>

<h2>THE LAWS OF WHIST.<br />

BY PERMISSION, <em>VERBATIM</em> FROM THE CLUB CODE.<br />

THE FOOT NOTES ARE ADDED BY THE AUTHOR.</h2>


<h3>THE RUBBER.</h3>

<p>1. The rubber is the best of three games. If the
first two games be won by the same players, the
third game is not played.</p>


<h3>SCORING.</h3>

<p>2. A game consists of five points. Each trick,
above six, counts one point.</p>

<p>3. Honours, <em>i.e.</em>, Ace, King, Queen, and Knave of
trumps, are thus reckoned:</p>

<p>If a player and his partner, either separately or
conjointly, hold&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<ol><li>The four honours, they score four points.</li>
<li>Any three honours, they score two points.</li>
<li>Only two honours, they do not score.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>4. Those players, who, at the commencement of a
deal, are at the score of four, cannot score honours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The penalty for a revoke<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> takes precedence
of all other scores. Tricks score next. Honours
last.</p>

<p>6. Honours, unless claimed before the trump card
of the following deal is turned up, cannot be
scored.</p>

<p>7. To score honours is not sufficient; they must
be called at the end of the hand; if so called,
they may be scored at any time during the
game.</p>

<p>8. The winners gain&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<ol>
<li>A treble, or game of three points, when their
adversaries have not scored.</li>

<li>A double, or game of two points, when their
adversaries have scored less than three.</li>

<li>A single, or game of one point, when their
adversaries have scored three, or four.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>9. The winners of the rubber gain two points
(commonly called the rubber points), in addition to
the value of their games.</p>

<p>10. Should the rubber have consisted of three
games, the value of the losers' game is deducted
from the gross number of points gained by their
opponents.</p>

<p>11. If an erroneous score be proved, such mistake
can be corrected prior to the conclusion of the game
in which it occurred, and such game is not concluded
until the trump card of the following deal has been
turned up.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>
<p>12. If an erroneous score, affecting the amount of
the rubber,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> be proved, such mistake can be rectified
at any time during the rubber.</p>


<h3>CUTTING.</h3>

<p>13. The ace is the lowest card.</p>

<p>14. In all cases, every one must cut from the same
pack.</p>

<p>15. Should a player expose more than one card, he
must cut again.</p>


<h3>FORMATION OF TABLE.</h3>

<p>16. If there are more than four candidates, the
players are selected by cutting: those first in the
room having the preference. The four who cut the
lowest cards play first, and again cut to decide on
partners; the two lowest play against the two
highest; the lowest is the dealer, who has choice of
cards and seats, and, having once made his selection,
must abide by it.</p>

<p>17. When there are more than six candidates,
those who cut the two next lowest cards belong
to the table, which is complete with six players;
on the retirement of one of those six players,
the candidate who cut the next lowest card
has a prior right to any after-comer to enter
the table.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<h3>CUTTING CARDS OF EQUAL VALUE.</h3>

<p>18. Two players cutting cards of equal value,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
unless such cards are the two highest, cut again;
should they be the two lowest, a fresh cut is
necessary to decide which of those two deals.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>19. Three players cutting cards of equal value
cut again; should the fourth (or remaining) card
be the highest, the two lowest of the new cut are
partners, the lower of those two the dealer; should
the fourth card be the lowest, the two highest are
partners, the original lowest the dealer.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>


<h3>CUTTING OUT.</h3>

<p>20. At the end of a rubber, should admission be
claimed by any one, or by two candidates, he who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>has, or they who have, played a greater number of
consecutive rubbers than the others is, or are,
out; but when all have played the same number,
they must cut to decide upon the out-goers; the
highest are out.</p>


<h3>ENTRY AND RE-ENTRY.</h3>

<p>21. A candidate wishing to enter a table must
declare such intention prior to any of the players
having cut a card, either for the purpose of commencing
a fresh rubber, or of cutting out.</p>

<p>22. In the formation of fresh tables, those candidates
who have neither belonged to nor played at
any other table have the prior right of entry; the
others decide their right of admission by cutting.</p>

<p>23. Any one quitting a table prior to the conclusion
of a rubber, may, with consent of the other three
players, appoint a substitute in his absence during
that rubber.</p>

<p>24. A player cutting into one table, whilst belonging
to another, loses his right<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of re-entry into that
latter, and takes his chance of cutting in, as if he
were a fresh candidate.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>25. If any one break up a table, the remaining
players have the prior right to him of entry into any
other, and should there not be sufficient vacancies
at such other table to admit all those candidates,
they settle their precedence by cutting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<h3>SHUFFLING.</h3>

<p>26. The pack must neither be shuffled below the
table nor so that the face of any card be seen.</p>

<p>27. The pack must not be shuffled during the play
of the hand.</p>

<p>28. A pack, having been played with, must neither be
shuffled, by dealing it into packets, nor across the table.</p>

<p>29. Each player has a right to shuffle, once only,
except as provided by Rule 32, prior to a deal, after
a false cut,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or when a new deal<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> has occurred.</p>

<p>30. The dealer's partner must collect the cards for the
ensuing deal, and has the first right to shuffle that pack.</p>

<p>31. Each player, after shuffling, must place the
cards, properly collected and face downwards, to the
left of the player about to deal.</p>

<p>32. The dealer has always the right to shuffle
last; but should a card or cards be seen during
his shuffling or whilst giving the pack to be cut,
he may be compelled to re-shuffle.</p>


<h3>THE DEAL.</h3>

<p>33. Each player deals in his turn; the right of
dealing goes to the left.</p>

<p>34. The player on the dealer's right cuts the pack,
and in dividing it, must not leave fewer than four
cards in either packet; if in cutting, or in replacing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>one of the two packets on the other, a card be
exposed,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> or if there be any confusion of the cards,
or a doubt as to the exact place in which the pack
was divided, there must be a fresh cut.</p>

<p>35. When a player, whose duty it is to cut, has
once separated the pack, he cannot alter his intention;
he can neither re-shuffle nor re-cut the cards.</p>

<p>36. When the pack is cut, should the dealer shuffle
the cards, he loses his deal.</p>


<h3>A NEW DEAL.</h3>

<p>37. There must be a new deal<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<ol>
<li>If, during a deal, or during the play of a hand,
the pack be proved incorrect or imperfect.</li>

<li>If any card, excepting the last, be faced in the
pack.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>38. If, whilst dealing, a card be exposed by the
dealer or his partner, should neither of the adversaries
have touched the cards, the latter can claim a new
deal; a card exposed by either adversary gives that
claim to the dealer, provided that his partner has not
touched a card; if a new deal does not take place, the
exposed card cannot be called.</p>

<p>39. If, during dealing, a player touch any of his
cards, the adversaries may do the same, without losing
their privilege of claiming a new deal, should chance
give them such option.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>40. If, in dealing, one of the last cards be exposed,
and the dealer turn up the trump before there is
reasonable time for his adversaries to decide as to a
fresh deal, they do not thereby lose their privilege.</p>

<p>41. If a player, whilst dealing, look at the trump
card, his adversaries have a right to see it, and may
exact a new deal.</p>

<p>42. If a player take into the hand dealt to him
a card belonging to the other pack, the adversaries, on
discovery of the error, may decide whether they will
have a fresh deal or not.</p>


<h3>A MISDEAL.</h3>

<p>43. A misdeal loses the deal.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>44. It is a misdeal<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;</p>
<div class="center"><ol>
<li>
Unless the cards are dealt into four packets,
one at a time in regular rotation, beginning
with the player to the dealer's left.</li>

<li>Should the dealer place the last (<em>i.e.</em>, the
trump) card, face downwards, on his own,
or any other pack.</li>

<li>Should the trump card not come in its regular
order to the dealer; but he does not lose
his deal if the pack be proved imperfect.</li>

<li>Should a player have fourteen<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> cards, and
either of the other three less than thirteen.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></li>

<li>Should the dealer, under an impression that he
has made a mistake, either count the cards
on the table, or the remainder of the pack.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></li>

<li>Should the dealer deal two cards at once, or
two cards to the same hand, and then deal
a third; but if, prior to dealing that third
card, the dealer can, by altering the position
of one card only, rectify such error, he may
do so, except as provided by the second
paragraph of this Law.</li>

<li>Should the dealer omit to have the pack cut
to him, and the adversaries discover the
error, prior to the trump card being turned
up, and before looking at their cards, but
not after having done so.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>45. A misdeal does not lose the deal if, during the
dealing, either of the adversaries touch the cards prior
to the dealer's partner having done so, but should the
latter have first interfered with the cards, notwithstanding
either or both of the adversaries have
subsequently done the same, the deal is lost.</p>

<p>46. Should three players have their right number
of cards&mdash;the fourth have less than thirteen, and not
discover such deficiency until he has played any of
his cards,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the deal stands good; should he have
played, he is as answerable for any revoke he may
have made as if the missing card, or cards, had been
in his hand;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> he may search the other pack for it,
or them.</p>

<p>47. If a pack, during or after a rubber, be proved
incorrect or imperfect, such proof does not alter any
past score, game, or rubber; that hand in which the
imperfection was detected is null and void; the dealer
deals again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>48. Any one dealing out of turn, or with the
adversary's cards, may be stopped before the trump
card is turned up, after which the game must proceed
as if no mistake had been made.</p>

<p>49. A player can neither shuffle, cut, nor deal for his
partner, without the permission of his opponents.</p>

<p>50. If the adversaries interrupt a dealer whilst
dealing, either by questioning the score or asserting
that it is not his deal, and fail to establish such claim,
should a misdeal occur, he may deal again.</p>

<p>51. Should a player take his partner's deal, and
misdeal, the latter is liable to the usual penalty, and
the adversary next in rotation to the player who ought
to have dealt then deals.</p>


<h3>THE TRUMP CARD.</h3>

<p>52. The dealer, when it is his turn to play to the
first trick, should take the trump card into his hand;
if left on the table after the first trick be turned and
quitted, it is liable to be called;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> his partner may
at any time remind him of the liability.</p>

<p>53. After the dealer has taken the trump card into
his hand, it cannot be asked for;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> a player naming it
at any time during the play of that hand is liable to
have his highest or lowest trump called.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>54. If the dealer take the trump card into his hand
before it is his turn to play, he may be desired to lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>it on the table; should he show a wrong card, this
card may be called, as also a second, a third, &amp;c.,
until the trump card be produced.</p>

<p>55. If the dealer declare himself unable to recollect
the trump card, his highest or lowest trump may be
called at any time during that hand, and, unless it
cause him to revoke, must be played; the call may be
repeated, but not changed, <em>i.e.</em>, from highest to lowest,
or <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, until such card is played.</p>


<h3>CARDS LIABLE TO BE CALLED.</h3>

<p>56. All exposed cards are liable to be called, and
must be left<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> on the table; but a card is not an
exposed card when dropped on the floor, or elsewhere
below the table.</p>

<p>The following are exposed<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> cards:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<ol>
<li>Two or more cards played at once.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></li>

<li>Any card dropped with its face upwards, or in
any way exposed on or above the table,
even though snatched up so quickly that
no one can name it.</li>
</ol>

</div>
<p>57. If any one play to an imperfect trick the best
card on the table,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> or lead one which is a winning card
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>as against his adversaries, and then lead again,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> or
play several such winning cards, one after the other,
without waiting for his partner to play, the latter may
be called on to win, if he can, the first or any other of
those tricks, and the other cards thus improperly
played are exposed cards.</p>

<p>58. If a player, or players, under the impression
that the game is lost&mdash;or won&mdash;or for other reasons&mdash;throw
his or their cards on the table face upwards,
such cards are exposed, and liable to be called, each
player's by the adversary; but should one player alone
retain his hand, he cannot be forced to abandon it.</p>

<p>59. If all four players throw their cards on the
table face upwards, the hands are abandoned; and
no one can again take up his cards. Should this
general exhibition show that the game might have
been saved, or won, neither claim can be entertained,
unless a revoke be established. The revoking players
are then liable to the following penalties: they cannot
under any circumstances win the game by the result
of that hand, and the adversaries may add three
to their score, or deduct three from that of the
revoking players.</p>

<p>60. A card detached from the rest of the hand so
as to be named is liable to be called; but should the
adversary name a wrong card, he is liable to have a
suit called when he or his partner have the lead.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>61. If a player, who has rendered himself liable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>have the highest or lowest of a suit called, fail to play
as desired, or if when called on to lead one suit, lead
another, having in his hand one or more cards of that
suit demanded, he incurs the penalty of a revoke.</p>

<p>62. If any player lead out of turn, his adversaries
may either call the card erroneously led&mdash;or may call
a suit from him or his partner when it is next the turn
of either of them<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> to lead.</p>

<p>63. If any player lead out of turn, and the other
three have followed him, the trick is complete, and the
error cannot be rectified; but if only the second, or
the second and third, have played to the false lead,
their cards, on discovery of the mistake, are taken
back; there is no penalty against any one, excepting
the original offender, whose card may be called&mdash;or
he, or his partner, when either of them<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> has next the
lead, may be compelled to play any suit demanded by
the adversaries.</p>

<p>64. In no case can a player be compelled to play a
card which would oblige him to revoke.</p>

<p>65. The call of a card may be repeated<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> until such
card has been played.</p>

<p>66. If a player called on to lead a suit have none of
it, the penalty is paid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<h3>CARDS PLAYED IN ERROR, OR NOT PLAYED
TO A TRICK.</h3>

<p>67. If the third hand play before the second, the
fourth hand may play before his partner.</p>

<p>68. Should the third hand not have played, and the
fourth play before his partner, the latter may be called
on to win, or not to win the trick.</p>

<p>69. If any one omit playing to a former trick, and
such error be not discovered until he has played to
the next, the adversaries may claim a new deal;
should they decide that the deal stand good, the
surplus card at the end of the hand is considered
to have been played to the imperfect trick, but does
not constitute a revoke therein.</p>

<p>70. If any one play two cards to the same trick, or
mix his trump, or other card, with a trick to which it
does not properly belong, and the mistake be not
discovered until the hand is played out, he is answerable
for all consequent revokes he may have made.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> If,
during the play of the hand, the error be detected, the
tricks may be counted face downwards, in order to
ascertain whether there be among them a card too
many: should this be the case they may be searched,
and the card restored; the player is, however, liable
for all revokes which he may have meanwhile made.</p>


<h3>THE REVOKE.</h3>

<p>71. Is when a player, holding one or more cards of
the suit led, plays a card of a different suit.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>72. The penalty for a revoke:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<ol>
<li>Is at the option of the adversaries, who, at the
end of the hand, may either take three
tricks from the revoking player<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>&mdash;or deduct
three points from his score&mdash;or add three to
their own score;</li>

<li>Can be claimed for as many revokes as occur
during the hand;</li>

<li>Is applicable only to the score of the game
in which it occurs;</li>

<li>Cannot be divided, i.e., a player cannot add
one or two to his own score and deduct one
or two from the revoking player;</li>

<li>Takes precedence of every other score, <em>e.g.</em>,&mdash;The
claimants two&mdash;their opponents nothing&mdash;the
former add three to their score&mdash;and
thereby win a treble game, even should the
latter have made thirteen tricks, and held
four honours.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>73. A revoke is established, if the trick in which it
occur be turned and quitted, <em>i.e.</em>, the hand removed
from that trick after it has been turned face downwards
on the table&mdash;or if either the revoking player or his
partner, whether in his right turn or otherwise, lead
or play to the following trick.</p>

<p>74. A player may ask his partner whether he has
not a card of the suit which he has renounced; should
the question be asked before the trick is turned and
quitted, subsequent turning and quitting does not
establish the revoke, and the error may be corrected,
unless the question be answered in the negative, or
unless the revoking player or his partner have led
or played to the following trick.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>75. At the end of the hand, the claimants of a
revoke may search all the tricks.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>76. If a player discover his mistake in time to save
a revoke, the adversaries, whenever they think fit, may
call the card thus played in error, or may require him
to play his highest or lowest card to that trick in
which he has renounced;&mdash;any player or players who
have played after him may withdraw their cards and
substitute others: the cards withdrawn are not liable
to be called.</p>

<p>77. If a revoke be claimed, and the accused player
or his partner mix the cards before they have been
sufficiently examined by the adversaries, the revoke is
established. The mixing of the cards only renders
the proof of a revoke difficult, but does not prevent the
claim, and possible establishment, of the penalty.</p>

<p>78. A revoke cannot be claimed after the cards
have been cut for the following deal.</p>

<p>79. The revoking player and his partner may,
under all circumstances, require the hand in which
the revoke has been detected to be played out.</p>

<p>80. If a revoke occur, be claimed and proved, bets
on the odd trick, or on amount of score, must be
decided by the actual state of the latter, after the
penalty is paid.</p>

<p>81. Should the players on both sides subject themselves
to the penalty of one or more revokes, neither
can win the game; each is punished at the discretion
of his adversary.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>82. In whatever way the penalty be enforced, under
no circumstances can a player win the game by the
result of the hand during which he has revoked; he
cannot score more than four. (<em>Vide</em> Rule 61.)</p>


<h3>CALLING FOR NEW CARDS.</h3>

<p>83. Any player (on paying for them) before, but
not after, the pack be cut for the deal, may call for
fresh cards. He must call for two new packs, of
which the dealer takes his choice.</p>


<h3>GENERAL RULES.</h3>

<p>84. Where a player and his partner have an
option of exacting from their adversaries one of
two penalties, they should agree who is to make
the election, but must not consult with one another
which of the two penalties it is advisable to exact;
if they do so consult they lose their right;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and if
either of them, with or without consent of his partner,
demand a penalty to which he is entitled, such
decision is final.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This rule does not apply in exacting the penalties for a
revoke; partners have then a right to consult.</p></div>

<p>85. Any one during the play of a trick, or after the
four cards are played, and before, but not after, they
are touched for the purpose of gathering them together,
may demand that the cards be placed before their
respective players.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>86. If any one, prior to his partner playing, should
call attention to the trick&mdash;either by saying that it is
his, or by naming his card, or, without being required
so to do, by drawing it towards him&mdash;the adversaries
may require that opponent's partner to play the
highest or lowest of the suit then led, or to win
or lose<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the trick.</p>

<p>87. In all cases where a penalty has been incurred,
the offender is bound to give reasonable time for
the decision of his adversaries.</p>

<p>88. If a bystander make any remark which calls
the attention of a player or players to an oversight
affecting the score, he is liable to be called on, by
the players only, to pay the stakes and all bets on
that game or rubber.</p>

<p>89. A bystander, by agreement among the players,
may decide any question.</p>

<p>90. A card or cards torn or marked must be either
replaced by agreement, or new cards called at the
expense of the table.</p>

<p>91. Any player may demand to see the last trick
turned, and no more. Under no circumstances can
more than eight cards be seen during the play of
the hand, viz.: the four cards on the table which
have not been turned and quitted, and the last
trick turned.</p>

<h2>ETIQUETTE OF WHIST.</h2>


<p>The following rules belong to the established Etiquette
of Whist. They are not called laws, as it is
difficult&mdash;in some cases impossible&mdash;to apply any
penalty to their infraction, and the only remedy is to
cease to play with players who habitually disregard
them.</p>

<p>Two packs of cards are invariably used at Clubs:
if possible this should be adhered to.</p>

<p>Any one, having the lead and several winning cards
to play, should not draw a second card out of his
hand until his partner has played to the first trick,
such act being a distinct intimation that the former
has played a winning card.</p>

<p>No intimation whatever, by word or gesture, should
be given by a player as to the state of his hand, or
of the game.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>A player who desires the cards to be placed, or
who demands to see the last trick,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> should do it for
his own information only, and not in order to invite
the attention of his partner.</p>

<p>No player should object to refer to a bystander who
professes himself uninterested in the game, and able
to decide any disputed question of facts; as to who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>played any particular card&mdash;whether honours were
claimed though not scored, or <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>&mdash;etc., etc.</p>

<p>It is unfair to revoke purposely; having made a
revoke, a player is not justified in making a second in
order to conceal the first.</p>

<p>Until the players have made such bets as they wish,
bets should not be made with bystanders.</p>

<p>Bystanders should make no remark, neither should
they by word or gesture give any intimation of the
state of the game until concluded and scored, nor
should they walk round the table to look at the
different hands.</p>

<p>No one should look over the hand of a player
against whom he is betting.</p>


<h3>DUMMY</h3>

<p>Is played by three players.</p>

<p>One hand, called Dummy's, lies exposed on the
table.</p>

<p>The laws are the same as those of Whist, with the
following exceptions:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<ol>
<li>Dummy deals at the commencement of each
rubber.</li>

<li>Dummy is not liable to the penalty for a
revoke, as his adversaries see his cards:
should he<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> revoke and the error not be
discovered until the trick is turned and
quitted, it stands good.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></li>

<li>Dummy being blind and deaf, his Partner is
not liable to any penalty for an error
whence he can gain no advantage. Thus, he
may expose some, or all of his cards, or
may declare that he has the game, or trick,
&amp;c., without incurring any penalty; if,
however, he lead from Dummy's Hand when
he should lead from his own, or <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, a
suit may be called from the hand which
ought to have led.</li>
</ol>
</div>


<h3>DOUBLE DUMMY</h3>

<p>Is played by two players, each having a Dummy or
exposed hand for his partner. The laws of the game do
not differ from Dummy Whist, except in the following
special law: There is no misdeal, as the deal is a
disadvantage.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> The question "Who dealt?" is irregular, and if asked should not

<h2>CASES AND DECISIONS.</h2>


<p>Card laws are intended to effect two objects: 1. To
preserve the harmony and determine the ordering of
the table. Such, for example, are the laws in the
previous code, which regulate scoring, cutting, shuffling,
&amp;c. and the miscellaneous rules included under
the head of Etiquette. 2. To prevent any player
from obtaining an unfair advantage.</p>

<p>The word "unfair" must be taken in a restricted
sense. It does not mean intentional unfairness. This
is not to be dealt with by laws, but by exclusion from
the card table. In deciding cases of card law, the
offender should be credited with <i lang="la">bonâ fides</i>. It follows
from this, that offences should not be judged by the
intention of the player, but by the amount of injury
which his irregularity may inflict on the opponents.</p>

<p>In a perfect code, there should be a penalty for all
errors or irregularities, by which the player committing
them, or his side, <em>might</em> profit; and on the
other hand there should be no penalty for errors by
which he who commits them, <em>cannot possibly</em> gain an
advantage.</p>

<p>Penalties should be proportioned as closely as
possible to the gain which might ensue to the offender.
For instance: if the third hand has not played and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the fourth plays before his partner, the second hand is
informed whether or not his partner is likely to win
the trick. The law, therefore, provides that the
adversaries shall be entitled to call on the second
player either to win the trick, or not to win it, whichever
they please. Say, the fourth hand plays an ace
out of turn. The second hand may be required to
win the trick. If he has none of the suit he must
trump it. In the opposite case, if the fourth hand
plays a small card, and the second is called on not to
win the trick, he must play a small card also. In this
manner, the second player is prevented from benefiting
by the irregular information afforded him. Other
offences are legislated against in a similar way, the
point kept in view throughout being, that no player
shall be allowed to profit by his own wrong doing.</p>

<p>However carefully a code is drawn up, it will not
unfrequently happen in practice, that cases occur
which are but imperfectly provided for. Such cases
should be referred for decision to some arbitrator.
The arbitrator will find himself materially assisted by
keeping well before him the two great objects with
which the laws have been framed.</p>

<p>The following general rules will also be found
useful in guiding him to just decisions:</p>

<p>Where two or more players are in fault, it should
be considered with whom the first fault lies, and how
far it induced or invited the subsequent error of the
adversary.</p>

<p>Questions of fact should be settled before the case
is referred, either by a majority of the players, or, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
they are divided in opinion, by an onlooker agreed to
by both parties, the decision of this referee being
final.</p>

<p>When the facts are agreed to they should be written
down, and the written statement submitted to the
judge, who should return a written answer.</p>

<p>Should it so happen that a case is referred, wherein
the players are divided in opinion as to the facts, the
arbitrator will do well to decline to give a decision.
The disputants, however, may be reminded that the
player whom it is proposed to punish is entitled to
the benefit of reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Questions of interpretation of law should be
decided liberally, in accordance with the spirit rather
than the letter of the law. On the other hand,
the arbitrator should bear in mind the great inconvenience
of a lax interpretation of card laws, and,
having made up his mind as to the intention of
the law, should decide all cases with the utmost
strictness.</p>

<p>The following cases, with decisions, selected from a
large number which have been brought under the
author's notice as having occurred in actual play, are
given in exemplification of the foregoing remarks.</p>


<h3>CASE I.</h3>

<p>The play of the hand shows that AB (partners)
hold no honour. The hand is therefore abandoned
and the adversaries (YZ) score the game. It is then
discovered that Y has only twelve cards, and one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the honours is found on the floor. AB then object
to the score on the ground that YZ only "held"
three honours (<em>vide</em> Law 3).</p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;YZ are entitled to score four by honours.
Y is not obliged to play with his cards in his hand.
Besides, the game having been abandoned, Law 59
comes into operation. The penalty for playing with
twelve cards is laid down in Law 46. Y is liable for
any revoke he may have made.</p>


<h3>CASE II.</h3>

<p>AB claim "the game" and score it. After the
trump card of the following deal is turned up, YZ
object that AB have not claimed honours (<em>vide</em> Laws
6 and 7).</p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;The honours were claimed within the
meaning of the law. The objection to the score, if
made really in ignorance of how it accrued, should
have been taken at once. YZ should not wait the
completion of the deal, so as to entrap AB on a mere
technicality.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> This is a good instance of interpretation
in accordance with the spirit of the law. Laws
should never be so construed as to inflict a wholly
unnecessary wrong, as would happen in this case
were the law insisted on literally. The intention of
Law 7 is to require AB to draw attention to the
claim; and this is sufficiently done by the claim of
"the game."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>


<h3>CASE III.</h3>

<p>Y throws down his hand and claims "the game."
B (Y's adversary) thinking that Y is referring only
to the tricks, says, "You are not game." Y then
marks four. After the trump card of the following
deal is turned up, A remarks, "if Y had scored his
honours, he would have been game." Y then claims
the game, on the ground that he made the claim in
time, and only withdrew it in consequence of B's
contradiction. Is Y entitled to score the game?</p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;No. Y's claim of "the game" is
irregular. He is bound to state in what way he wins
it (<em>vide</em> Law 6). There is no evidence that Y was
referring to his honours when he claimed the game,
but rather the contrary, as he afterwards withdrew his
claim and said nothing about honours.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> This is an example of two players being in
fault. It seems hard on Y that he should suffer
through B's mistake; but it must be borne in
mind that the confusion was introduced by Y's own
irregularity, and that the omission to score honours
was due to his subsequent forgetfulness.</p>

<p class="center">Compare with Case II.
</p>


<h3>CASE IV.</h3>

<p>At the conclusion of the deal the trump card comes
to the hand on the dealer's left. The dealer requests
the players to count their cards. The player to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
dealer's left appropriates a packet of cards lying a
little to his own right hand, between himself and the
dealer, and finds twelve cards in it. The other hands
each contain thirteen. The dealer now claims the hand
with twelve cards in it as his hand. Must the players
accept the hands thus given to them, or is it a misdeal?</p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;It is a misdeal. The fault is entirely
with the dealer. If he deals so carelessly that there
is any doubt as to the ownership of the hands, he
must apportion them, and having once done so, he
must not shift the hands about, so as to make a hand
with twelve cards in it fall to himself.</p>


<h3>CASE V.</h3>

<p>Y throws down his cards, remarking, "We have
lost the game." On this, A and B (Y's adversaries)
throw down their cards. Z retains his hand. AB
plead that they were misled by Y and that therefore
they are not liable to Law 58.</p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;A's, Y's, and B's hands are exposed, and
must be left on the table to be called, each player's by
the adversary. Z is not bound to abandon the game
because his partner chooses to do so. Consequently,
Y's remark does not bind Z. A and B ought to keep
up their cards, until they have ascertained that both
adversaries have abandoned the game.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> The written law is sufficient to decide this
case (<em>vide</em> Law 58); but inasmuch as the irregularity
in question is a fertile source of disputes, the case has
been deemed worthy of insertion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>


<h3>CASE VI.</h3>

<p>When it comes to the last trick of a hand, it appears
that the player who has to lead has no card. What is
to be done?</p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;(<em>a</em>) If either of the other players remains
with two cards, it is a misdeal (<em>vide</em> Law 44, paragraph
iv). (<em>b</em>) If the other players have their right number
of cards, the missing card should be searched for (<em>vide</em>
Law 70) and when found assigned to the leader, who is
liable to Law 46. (<em>c</em>) If the missing card cannot be
found, the tricks may be searched to find what card is
wanting, and the absent card assumed to have belonged
to the player who had but twelve cards.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> It may seem that decision <em>c</em> is severe on a
player playing <i lang="la">bonâ fide</i> with an imperfect pack. But
each player should protect himself, by counting his
hand before he plays. His playing to the first trick
signifies his acceptance of the hand. If he accepts an
imperfect one he must take the consequences.</p>


<h3>CASE VII.</h3>

<p>Towards the end of a hand a spade is led. The
third hand, when it comes to his turn to play, lays
down the ace of trumps (hearts) and says "There's
the game." He then throws his hand on the table.
The hand contains several spades. Is it a revoke?</p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;It is a question of fact. If the card was
exposed in order to save time, it is not a revoke. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
if the ace of trumps was played to the trick it is a
revoke, the subsequent throwing down of the cards
being an act of play, equivalent to playing to the
following trick (<em>vide</em> Law 73).</p>


<h3>CASE VIII.</h3>

<p>The adversary cuts the pack to the dealer, but
without his consent, <em>i.e.</em>, without the dealer's presenting
it to be cut. Is it too late to claim a revoke in
the previous hand? (<em>vide</em> Law 78).</p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;It is too late for the player who cut or
for his partner to claim a revoke, but not too late for
the adversaries.</p>


<h3>CASE IX.</h3>

<p>A player revokes, and on discovering the revoke
before the hand is played out, says in explanation, "I
never saw the card; it was hidden behind my king of
diamonds"&mdash;the king of diamonds being still in his
hand.</p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;The king of diamonds is constructively an
exposed card, and the adversaries may require that it
be laid on the table to be called.</p>


<h3>CASE X.</h3>

<p>Y leads out of turn. B (Y's adversary) says to his
partner, "Shall we call a suit or not?" B's partner
gives no answer. Is the asking the question a consultation
within the meaning of Law 84, although no
answer is made to it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;Yes. It is the very question Law 84 is
framed to prevent. B by the question shows that he
is in doubt as to the policy of calling a suit, and thus
affords information he has no right to give. Further
than this, a reply by word of mouth is not necessary
to constitute a consultation. Silence is an answer.
The knowledge that a partner is indifferent may convey
information that B has no right to extract.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> The usual formula is "Will you exact the
penalty, or shall I?" This question does not bring
the player under the operation of Law 84.</p>


<h3>CASE XI.</h3>

<p>A leads and the other three players follow suit. A
plays another card (it not being his lead) and proceeds
to gather the five cards into one trick. On being told
of it, A explains that his attention has been diverted,
and that he thought he had not played to the trick.
The adversaries claim to be entitled to the penalties
for leading out of turn, on the ground that the penalty
should depend, not on the actual intention of the
player, but on his possible intention.</p>

<p><em>Decision</em>&mdash;A has not led out of turn; he has merely
exposed a card. The abstract principle pleaded by
the adversaries is quite sound, but it does not apply
to this case. A's word must be taken as correctly
representing the fact that he played a second time to
one trick.</p>

<h2>WHIST.<br />

HISTORICAL.</h2>


<p>The early history of Whist is involved in obscurity.
All games of high character become perfected by
degrees; and Whist, following this rule, has been
formed by gradual development. As early as the
beginning of the sixteenth century, a card game
called <em>triumph</em> or <em>trump</em> was commonly played in
England. This game in its chief feature, viz., the
predominance of one particular suit, and in its
general construction, was so similar to Whist, that
no one can doubt it to have been the game from
which Whist grew.</p>

<p>There were two distinct games called trump.
<em>Triomphe</em> or <em>French ruff</em> was very like écarté, only
there was no score for the king; Trump or <em>English
ruff-and-honours</em> closely resembled Whist.</p>

<p>Berni ("<cite>Capitolo del Gioco della Primera</cite>," Rome,
1526), enumerates several games at cards; among
them are <em>trionfi</em>, played by the peasants; and <em>ronfa</em>,
the invention of which is attributed to King Ferdinand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Triumphus Hispanicus</em> is the subject of a "Dialogue"
written in Latin and French by Vives, a Spaniard
(d. 1541).</p>

<p><em>La triomphe</em> and <em>la ronfle</em> are included by Rabelais
(first half of sixteenth century) in the long list of some
two hundred and thirty games played by Gargantua.</p>

<p>In "A Worlde of Wordes or Most copious and
exact <em>Dictionarie</em> in Italian and <em>English</em> collected by
John Florio, 1598," <em>ronfa</em> is defined as "<em>a game at
cardes called ruffe or trumpe</em>;" and under <em>trionfo</em> we
find "<em>triumph. * * * Also a trump at cards, or the
play called trump or ruff</em>."</p>

<p>There is no evidence to show whether the above
were the foreign or native form of trump. Douce,
in his "Illustrations of Shakespeare," concludes, from
finding <i lang="fr">la triomphe</i> in Rabelais' list, that we derived
the game of trump from a French source. But it
seems more probable, from the non-appearance of
English ruff-and-honours in the <cite>Académie des Jeux</cite>,
and from the distinction drawn in Cotton's "Compleat
Gamester" between "English ruff-and-honours" and
"French ruff" (<i lang="fr">la triomphe</i> of the <cite>Académie</cite>), that
the game referred to by Berni, Vives, Rabelais, and
Florio, was not the same game as English ruff-and-honours,
for which a purely English origin (as the
name implies) may be claimed.</p>

<p>How and when trump or English ruff-and-honours
originated cannot now be ascertained. It was played
at least as early as the time of Henry VIII., for it
was taken by Latimer to illustrate his text, in the first
of two sermons "Of the Card," preached by him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Cambridge, in Advent, about the year 1529. He
mentions the game under its original and corrupted
appellations, and clearly alludes to its characteristic
feature, as the following extract will show.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"And where you are wont to celebrate Christmass in
playing at Cards, I intend, with God's grace, to deal unto
you Christ's Cards, wherein you shall perceive Christ's
Rule. The game that we play at shall be the Triumph,
which, if it be well played at, he that dealeth shall win;
the Players shall likewise win, and the standers and
lookers upon shall do the same. * * * You must mark
also, that the Triumph must apply to fetch home unto
him all the other Cards, whatsoever suit they be of. * * *
Then further we must say to ourselves, 'What requireth
Christ of a Christian man?' Now turn up your Trump,
your Heart (Hearts is Trump, as I said before) and cast
your Trump, your Heart, on this card."</p></div>

<p>Later in the century trump is often referred to. In
"Gammer Gurton's Nedle, made by Mr. S., Mr of
Art [Bishop Still] 1575," the second piece performed
in England under the name of a comedy (performed
at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1566), Old Dame
Chat thus invites some friends to a game:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i6">Take hede of Sim glover's wife, she hath an eie behind her."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In Eliot's "Fruits for the French" (1593), trump
is called "a verie common alehouse game;" and Rice,
in his "Invective against Vices" (printed before
1600), observes that "renouncing the trompe and
comming in againe" (<em>i.e.</em>, revoking intentionally), is a
common sharper's trick. Decker, in "The Belman
of London" (1608), speaks of "the deceites practised
(euen in the fairest and most ciuill companies) at
Primero, Saint, Maw, Tromp, and such like games."</p>

<p>The game of trump is also mentioned by Shakespeare
in "Antony and Cleopatra," Act iv., scene 12
(first published 1623).</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">Ant.</span> My good knave, Eros, now thy Captain is<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The repeated punning allusions to card-playing in
this passage leave no doubt as to the reference in the
last word. Douce ("Illustrations") points out its
real meaning, and ridicules Ben Jonson's derivation
of the word trump from <em>tromper</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>There is abundant evidence to show that trump is a
corruption of the word triumph. In addition to the
instances already given, the following may be quoted:
In Cotgrave's "Dictionarie of the French and English
Tongve" (1611), <em>Triomphe</em> is explained as "<em>the Card-game
called Ruffe or Trump; also the Ruffe or Trump
at it</em>." Minsheu, in "The Guide unto Tongues"
(1617), gives, "The <span class="smcap">Trumpe</span> <i lang="la">in cardes. Triumfo, ita
dict</i>: quod de <i lang="la">cæteris chartis</i> triumphare videatur,
<i lang="la">quod illis sit præstantior</i>." Seymour, in his "Court
Gamester" (1719), says&mdash;"The Term <em>Trump</em> comes
from a Corruption of the Word <em>Triumph</em>; for
wherever they are, they are attended with Conquest."
Ash ("Dictionary, 1775") has "Triumph (<em>s. from the</em>
Lat. triumphus). * * * A conquering card, a trump;
<em>but this sense is now become obsolete</em>. Trump (<em>s. from</em>
triumph)."</p>

<p>The derivation of the word <em>ruff</em> or <em>ruffe</em> has caused
much speculation. The previous quotations show
that it is the same word as <em>ronfa</em> (Ital.) and <em>ronfle</em> (Fr.),
and that it is synonymous with the English triumph
or trump. Even at the present day many Whist
players speak of ruffing, <em>i.e.</em>, trumping; and, in the
expression a cross-ruff, the word ruff is preserved to
the exclusion of the word trump.</p>

<p>The game of <em>ruff-and-honours</em>, if not the same as
trump or ruff, was probably the same game, with the
addition of certain advantages to the four highest
cards of the trump suit. Rabelais includes in his list
a game called "<i lang="fr">les Honneurs</i>," but whether it had any
affinity to ruff-and-honours is doubtful. In "Shufling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Cutting, and Dealing, in a Game at Pickquet: being
Acted from the Year, 1653. to 1658. By O.P. [Oliver
Protector] and others; With great Applause." (1659),
the "Old Foolish Christmas Game with <em>Honours</em>" is
mentioned. Some writers are of opinion that trump
was originally played without honours; but as no description
of trump without honours is known to exist,
their view must be taken as conjectural. In 1674,
Charles Cotton, the poet, published a description of
ruff-and-honours in "The Compleat Gamester: or
Instructions How to play at Billiards, Trucks,
Bowls, and Chess. Together with all manner of
usual and most Gentile <span class="smcap">Games</span>, either on Cards or
Dice." Cotton gives a drawing of the game of
"English Ruff and Honours," (see frontispiece) and
thus describes it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At Ruff and Honours, by some called Slamm, you have
in the Pack all the Deuces, and the reason is, because four
playing having dealt twelve a piece, there are four left for
the Stock, the uppermost whereof is turn'd up, and that
is Trumps, he that hath the Ace of that Ruffs; that is, he
takes in those four Cards, and lays out four others in their
lieu; the four Honours are the Ace, King, Queen, and
Knave; he that hath three Honours in his own hand, his
partner not having the fourth sets up Eight by Cards,
that is two tricks; if he hath all four, then Sixteen, that
is four tricks; it is all one if two Partners make them
three or four between them, as if one had them. If the
Honours are equally divided among the Gamesters of each
side, then they say Honours are split. If either side are
at Eight Groats he hath the benefit of calling Can-ye, if he
hath two Honours in his hand, and if the other answers
one, the Game is up, which is nine in all, but if he hath
more than two he shows them, and then it is one and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
same thing; but it he forgets to call after playing a trick,
he loseth the advantage of Can-ye for that deal.</p>

<p>"All Cards are of value as they are superiour one to
another, as a Ten wins a Nine if not Trumps, so a Queen,
a Knave in like manner; but the least Trump will win
the highest Card of any other Card [suit]; where note
the Ace is the highest."</p></div>

<p>This game was clearly Whist in an imperfect form.
Whist is not mentioned by Shakespeare, nor by any
writer (it is believed) of the Elizabethan era. It is
probable that the introduction of the name <em>whist</em> or
<em>whisk</em> took place early in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The first known appearance of the word in print is
in the "Motto" of Taylor, the Water Poet (1621).
Taylor spells the word whisk. Speaking of the
prodigal, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Prodigals estate, like to a flux.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mercer, Draper, and the Silkman sucks:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">*     *     *     *     *     *    *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He flings his money free with carelessnesse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Novum, Mumchance, mischance, (chuse ye which)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At One and Thirty, or at Poore and rich,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruffe, slam, Trump, nody, whisk, hole, Sant, New-cut."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The word continued to be spelt whisk for about
forty years. The earliest known use of the present
spelling is in "Hudibras the Second Part" (spurious)
published in 1663:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But what was this? A Game at Whist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto our <em>Plowden-Canonist</em>."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>After this, the word is spelt indifferently, whisk or
whist. In "The Compleat Gamester" (1674 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
subsequent editions) Cotton says, under playing the
cards at "Picket," "the elder begins and younger
follows in suit as at Whisk." But he uses the other
spelling in his chapter on the game itself. He observes,
"Ruff and Honours (<em>alias</em> Slamm) and Whist, are
Games so commonly known in <em>England</em> in all parts
thereof, that every Child almost of Eight Years old
hath a competent knowledge in that recreation."</p>

<p>After describing ruff-and-honours (see the passage
quoted, pp. <a href="#Page_36">36</a>, <a href="#Page_37">37</a>), Cotton adds, "Whist is a game
not much differing from this, only they put out the
Deuces and take in no stock; and is called Whist
from the silence that is to be observed in the play;
they deal as before, playing four, two of a side * * *
to each Twelve a piece, and the Trump is the bottom
Card. The manner of crafty playing, the number of
the Game Nine, Honours and dignity of other Cards
are all alike, and he that wins most tricks is most
forward to win the set."</p>

<p>Cotton's work was afterwards incorporated with
Seymour's Court-Gamester (first published 1719).
The earlier editions contain no Whist, but after the
two books were united (about 1734), Seymour says,
"Whist, vulgarly called whisk. The original denomination
of this game is Whist, [here Seymour is
mistaken] or the silent game at cards." And again,
"Talking is not allowed at Whist; the very word
implies 'Hold your Tongue.'"</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson does not positively derive Whist from
the <i lang="la">interjectio silentium imperans</i>; he cautiously explains
Whist to be "a game at cards, requiring close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
attention and silence." Nares, in his "Glossary," has
"Whist, an interjection commanding silence;" and he
adds, "That the name of the game of Whist is derived
from this, is known, I presume, to all who play or do
not play." Skeat ("Etymological Dictionary of the
English Language, 1882") gives, "Whist, hush,
silence; a game at cards * * * named from the
silence requisite to play it attentively."</p>

<p>Chatto, however, ("Facts and Speculations on the
Origin and History of Playing Cards, 1848"), suggests
that whisk is derived by substitution from ruff, both
of them signifying a piece of lawn used as an ornament
to the dress.</p>

<p>The best modern etymologists are of opinion that,
whisk and whist, being, like whisper, whistle, wheeze,
hush and hist, words of imitative origin, it makes no
difference which form is first found. So the received
derivation from silence, having a good deal of evidence
in its favour, may be accepted until some more conclusive
arguments than Chatto's are brought against it.</p>

<p>While Whist was undergoing the changes of name
and character already specified, there was for a time
associated with it another title, viz., swabbers or
swobbers. Fielding, in his "History of the life of
the late Mr. Jonathan Wild, the Great," records that
when the ingenious Count La Ruse was domiciled
with Mr. Geoffrey Snap, in 1682, or, in other words,
was in a spunging-house, the Count beguiled the
tedium of his in-door existence by playing at Whisk-and-Swabbers,
"the game then in the chief vogue."
Swift, in "The Intelligencer" (No. v, Dublin, 1728),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
ridicules Archbishop Tenison for not understanding
the meaning of swabbers. "There is a known Story of
a <em>Clergy-Man</em>, who was recommended for a Preferment
by some great Man at Court, to A. B. C'T.
His Grace said, he had heard that the <em>Clergy-Man</em>
used to play at Whisk and Swobbers, that as to
playing now and then a Sober Game at Whisk for
pastime, it might be pardoned, but he could not digest
those wicked Swobbers, and it was with some pains
that my Lord <em>S&mdash;&mdash;rs</em> could undeceive him." Johnson
defines swobbers as "four privileged cards used
incidentally in betting at Whist." In Captain Francis
Grose's "Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue"
(1785), swabbers are stated to be "The ace of hearts,
knave of clubs, ace and duce of trumps at Whist." The
Hon. Daines Barrington (writing in 1786), says that at
the beginning of the century, whisk was "played with
what were called <em>Swabbers</em>, which were possibly so
termed, because they, who had certain cards in their
hand, were entitled to take up a share of the stake,
independent of the general event of the game." This
was probably the true office of the swabbers, the
etymology of the word showing it to be allied to sweep,
swoop, swab, swap, and to be first cousin to sweepstakes.
Swabbers soon went out of general use, but they
may still linger in some local coteries. R. B. Wormald
writes thus respecting them in 1873:&mdash;Being driven
by stress of weather to take shelter in a sequestered
hostelry on the Berkshire bank of the Thames, he found
four persons immersed in the game of Whist: "In
the middle of the hand, one of the players, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
grin that almost mounted to a chuckle, and a vast
display of moistened thumb, spread out upon the
table the ace of trumps; whereupon the other three
deliberately laid down their hands, and forthwith
severally handed over the sum of one penny to the
fortunate holder of the card in question. On enquiry,
we were informed that the process was technically
known as a 'swap' (qy. swab or swabber), and was
<i lang="fr">de rigueur</i> in all property constituted whist circles."</p>

<p>After the swabbers were dropped (and it is probable
that they were not in general use in the eighteenth
century), our national card game became known simply
as Whist, though still occasionally spelt whisk. The
Hon. Daines Barrington ("Archaeologia," Vol. viii.)
says, that Whist in its infancy was chiefly confined to
the servants' hall. That the game had not yet become
fashionable is evident from the disparaging way in
which it is referred to by writers of the period. In
Farquhar's comedy of "The Beaux's Stratagem"
(1707), Mrs. Sullen, a fine lady from London, speaks
in a contemptuous vein of the "rural Accomplishments
of drinking fat Ale, playing at Whisk, and smoaking
Tobacco." Pope also classes Whist as a country squire's
game, in his "Epistle to Mrs. Teresa Blount" (1715)&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some Squire, perhaps, you take delight to rack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose game is Whisk, whose treat a toast in sack."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Thomson, in his "Autumn" (1730), describes how
after a heavy hunt dinner&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Perhaps a while, amusive, thoughtful Whisk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walks gentle round, beneath a cloud of smoak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wreath'd, fragrant, from the pipe."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>Early in the century the points of the game rose
from nine to ten ("nine in all," Cotton, 1709; "ten
in all," Cotton, 1721; "nine in all," Cotton, 1725;
"ten in all," Seymour, 1734, "rectified according to
the present standard of play"). Every subsequent
edition of Seymour (with which Cotton was incorporated)
makes the game ten up. It seems likely
that, simultaneously with this change, or closely
following it, the practice of playing with the entire
pack instead of with but forty-eight cards obtained.
This improvement introduced the <em>odd trick</em>, an element
of the greatest interest in modern Whist.</p>

<p>At this period (early part of the eighteenth century)
there was a mania for card playing in all parts of
Europe, and in all classes of society, but Whist had
not as yet found favour in the highest circles. Piquet,
Ombre, and Quadrille, were the principal games of
the fashionable world. But about 1728, the game of
Whist rose out of its comparative obscurity.</p>

<p>A party of gentlemen (according to Daines Barrington),
of whom the first Lord Folkestone was one, used
at this date to frequent the Crown Coffee-house, in
Bedford Row, where they studied Whist scientifically.
They must have made considerable progress in the
game, to judge by the following rules which they laid
down:&mdash;"Lead from the strong suit; study your
partner's hand; and attend to the score."</p>

<p>Shortly after this, the celebrated <span class="smcap">Edmond Hoyle</span>,
the father of the game, published his "Short Treatise"
(1742-3). About Hoyle's antecedents, but little is
known. He was born in 1672; it is said he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
educated for the bar. It has been stated that he was
born in Yorkshire, but this is doubtful. At all events,
the author, by personal enquiry, has positively ascertained
that he did not belong to the family of Yorkshire
Hoyles, who acquired estates near Halifax <em>temp.</em>
Edward III. It has also been stated that Hoyle was
appointed registrar of the prerogative court at Dublin,
in 1742. This, however, is unlikely. At that time,
Hoyle was engaged in writing on games, and in
giving lessons in Whist, and he was probably living
in London. At all events, the only known genuine
copy of the first edition of the "Short Treatise" (in
the Bodleian), was published in London; and Hoyle
afterwards resided in Queen Square. The name
Edmund or Edmond is common in both the Yorkshire
and Irish families of Hoyle; and probably one
Hoyle has been mistaken for another.</p>

<p>Internal evidence shows that Hoyle originally drew
up notes for the use of his pupils. His early editions
speak of "Purchasers of the <cite>Treatise</cite> in Manuscript,
disposed of the last Winter," and further state that
the author of it "has fram'd an <em>Artificial Memory</em>,
which takes not off your Attention from your Game;
and if required, he is ready to communicate it, upon
Payment of one Guinea. And also, he will explain
any <em>Cases</em> in the Book, upon Payment of one Guinea
more." The cheap spurious editions lament that there
was "a Treatise on the Game of <em>Whist</em> lately dispersed
among a <em>few</em> Hands at a <em>Guinea</em> Price;" that it was to
be procured with no small difficulty; and that the
public lay under imposition and hardship in not being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
able to get the book under a guinea, and by its being
reserved only in a few hands.</p>

<p>No doubt, the circulation of these surreptitious
copies induced Hoyle to print the manuscript, and
to register the "Short Treatise" at Stationers' Hall
in November, 1742.</p>

<p>The treatise ran through five editions in one year,
and it is said that Hoyle received a large sum for the
copyright. This last statement, however, requires
verification; at all events, Hoyle continued for years
to sign every copy personally, as the proprietor of the
copyright. This was done in order to protect the
property from further piracy, as the address to the
reader shows.</p>

<p>The following is a facsimile of Hoyle's signature,
taken from the fourth edition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image0044.jpg" width="700" height="182" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the fifteenth edition the signature is impressed
from a wood block, and in the seventeenth it was
announced that Mr. Hoyle was dead. He died in
Welbank (Welbeck) Street, Cavendish Square, in
August, 1769, aged 97.</p>

<p>One effect of Hoyle's publication was to draw forth
a witty skit, entitled "The Humours of Whist. A
Dramatic Satire, as Acted every Day at <em><span class="smcap">White</span>'s</em> and
other <em>Coffee-Houses</em> and <em>Assemblies</em>." (1743). The
pamphlet commences with an advertisement mimicking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Hoyle's address to the reader. The prologue to the
play is "supposed to be spoke by a waiter at White's."</p>

<p><em>Lurch.</em> But if this damn'd Book of the Professor's

<p><em>Shuf.</em> I must confess the Publication of his Treatise
gave me at first some slight Alarm; but I did not,
like thee, <em>Lurchum</em>, indulge in melancholy desponding
Thoughts: On the contrary, I called up my Indignation
to my Assistance, and have ever since been working upon
a private Treatise on <em>Signs</em> at <em>Whist</em>, by way of counter
Treatise to his, and which, if I mistake not, totally
overthrows his System."</p></div>

<p>On the other hand, the gentlemen are in raptures.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Parliament with it&mdash;go to Church with it.&mdash;I pronounce
it the Gospel of Whist-Players; and the Laws of the

in Coffee-houses, as much as the Ten Commandments in

Author, and can look on him in no other Light than as a
second <em>Newton</em>."</p></div>

<p>The way in which Sir Calculation introduces Hoyle's
Calculations of Chances is very amusing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Sir <em>John</em>. 'Twas by some such laudable Practices, I
suppose, that you suffered in your last Affair with
Lurchum.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Cal.</em> O Gad, No, Sir <em>John</em>&mdash;Never any thing was
fairer, nor was ever any thing so critical.&mdash;We were nine
all. The adverse Party had 3, and we had 4 Tricks. All
the Trumps were out. I had Queen and two small Clubs,
with the Lead. Let me see&mdash;It was about 222 and
3 Halves to&mdash;'gad. I forgot how many&mdash;that my Partner
had the Ace and King&mdash;let me recollect&mdash;ay&mdash;that he had
one only was about 31 to 26.&mdash;That he had not both of
them 17 to 2,&mdash;and that he had not one, or both, or
neither, some 25 to 32.&mdash;So I, according to the Judgment
of the Game, led a Club, my Partner takes it with the
King. Then it was exactly 481 for <em>us</em> to 222 against <em>them</em>.
He returns the same Suit; I win it with my Queen, and
return it again; but the Devil take that <em>Lurchum</em>, by
passing his Ace twice, he took the Trick, and having 2
more Clubs and a 13th Card, I gad, all was over.&mdash;But
they both allow'd I play'd admirably well for all that."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>The following passage from the same pamphlet
mentions the Crown&mdash;probably the Crown Coffee-house&mdash;and
it has been inferred from this that Hoyle
himself might have been one of Lord Folkestone's
party.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<em>Young Jobber</em> [A pupil of the Professor's]. Dear, Mr.
<em>Professor</em>, I can never repay you.&mdash;You have given me
such an Insight by this Visit, I am quite another Thing&mdash;I
find I knew nothing of the Game before; tho' I can
assure you, I have been reckoned a First-rate Player in
the City a good while&mdash;nay, for that Matter, I make no
bad figure at the <em>Crown</em>&mdash;and don't despair, by your
Assistance, but to make one at <em>White's</em> soon."</p></div>

<p>Hoyle is also spoken of in his professional capacity
in "The Rambler" of May 8, 1750. A "Lady that
has lost her Money" writes, "As for Play, I do think
I may, indeed, indulge in that, now I am my own
Mistress. Papa made me drudge at Whist 'till I was
tired of it; and far from wanting a Head, Mr. <em>Hoyle</em>,
when he had not given me above forty Lessons, said,
I was one of his best Scholars."</p>

<p>Again, in "The Gentleman's Magazine" for
February, 1755, a writer, professing to give the autobiography
of a modern physician, says, "<em>Hoyle</em>
tutor'd me in the several games at cards, and under
the name of guarding me from being cheated, insensibly
gave me a taste for sharping."</p>

<p>In the middle of the eighteenth century, Whist was
regularly played in fashionable society. In "Tom
Jones," Lady Bellaston, Lord Fellamar, and others,
are represented as indulging in a rubber. Hoyle also
comes in for notice in the following passage in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
same work: "I happened to come home several Hours
before my usual Time, when I found four Gentlemen
of the Cloth at Whisk by my fire;&mdash;and my <em>Hoyle</em>,
sir;&mdash;my best <em>Hoyle</em>, which cost me a Guinea, lying
open on the Table, with a Quantity of Porter spilt on
one of the most material Leaves of the whole Book.
This, you will allow, was provoking; but I said
nothing till the rest of the honest Company were gone,
and then gave the Fellow a gentle Rebuke, who,
instead of expressing any Concern, made me a pert
Answer, 'That Servants must have their Diversions as
well as other People; that he was sorry for the
Accident which had happened to the Book; but that
several of his Acquaintance had bought the same for
a Shilling; and that I might stop as much in his
Wages, if I pleased.'"</p>

<p>In an epic poem on "Whist," by Alexander Thomson,
which appeared in 1791, Hoyle was thus invoked&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>Hoyle's name also finds a place in Don Juan.
Byron, in saying that Troy owes to Homer what
Whist owes to Hoyle, scarcely does justice to Hoyle,
who was rather the founder than the historian of
Whist.</p>

<p>The "Short Treatise" appeared just in the nick of
time, when Whist was rising in repute, and when
card-playing was the rage. The work became the
authority almost from the date of its appearance.</p>

<p>In 1760, the laws of the game were revised by the
members of White's and Saunders's Chocolate-houses,
then the head quarters of fashionable play. These
revised laws (nearly all Hoyle) are given in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
edition of Hoyle from this date. Hoyle's laws, as they
were called, guided all Whist coteries for a hundred
and four years; when the Arlington (now Turf) and
Portland Clubs, re-revised the code of the Chocolate-houses.
The code agreed to by the Committees of
both Clubs was adopted in 1864; it shortly found
its way into all Whist circles, deposed Hoyle, and is
now (1874) the standard by which disputed points
are determined.</p>

<p>One of the chief seats of card-playing, and consequently,
of Whist-playing, during the eighteenth
century, was Bath. Even Mr. Pickwick is depicted
playing Whist there with Miss Bolo, against the
Dowager Lady Snuphanuph and Mrs. Colonel Wugsby,
in a passage too well known to require quotation.
Mr. Pickwick's visit was at a date when the chief
glories of Bath had departed. Hoyle's first edition,
it will be remembered, was published at Bath, as also
was Thomas Mat[t]hews' "Advice to the Young Whist
Player" (about 1805)&mdash;a sound and useful contribution
to Whist literature.</p>

<p>Early in this century, the points of the game were
altered from ten to five, and calling honours was
abolished. It is doubtful whether this change was
for the better. In the author's opinion Long Whist
(ten up) is a far finer game than Short Whist (five up);
Short Whist, however, has taken such a hold, that
there is no chance of our reverting to the former game.
According to Clay ("Short Whist," 1864), the alteration
took place under the following circumstances:
"Some sixty or seventy years back, Lord Peterborough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
having one night lost a large sum of money, the friends
with whom he was playing proposed to make the game
five points instead of ten, in order to give the loser a
chance, at a quicker game, of recovering his loss. The
late Mr. Hoare, of Bath, a very good whist-player, and
without a superior at piquet, was one of this party,
and has more than once told me the story. The new
game was found to be so lively, and money changed
hands with such increased rapidity, that these gentlemen
and their friends, all of them members of the
leading clubs of the day, continued to play it. It
became general in the clubs&mdash;thence was introduced
in private houses&mdash;travelled into the country&mdash;went
to Paris, and has long since * * entirely superseded
the whist of Hoyle's day."</p>

<p>Long Whist had long been known in France, but it
was not a popular game in that country. Hoyle has
been several times translated into French. Whist was
played by Louis XV., and under the first Empire was
a favorite game with Josephine and Marie Louise. It
is on record ("Diaries of a Lady of Quality," 2nd Ed.
p. 128), that Napoleon used to play Whist at Würtemburg,
but not for money, and that he played ill
and inattentively. One evening, when the Queen
Dowager was playing against him with her husband
and his daughter (the Queen of Westphalia, the wife
of Jerome), the King stopped Napoleon, who was
taking up a trick that did not belong to him, saying,
"<i lang="fr">Sire, on ne joue pas ici en conquérant.</i>" After the
restoration, Whist was taken up in France more
enthusiastically. "The Nobles," says a French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
writer, "had gone to England to learn to Think, and
they brought back the thinking game with them."
Talleyrand was a Whist player, and his <em>mot</em> to the
youngster who boasted his ignorance of the game is
well known. "<i lang="fr">Vous ne savez pas le Whiste, jeune
homme? Quelle triste vieillesse vous vous préparez!</i>"
Charles X. is reported to have been playing Whist
at St. Cloud, on July 29, 1830, when the tricolor
was waving on the Tuileries, and he had lost his
throne.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the "finest Whist player"
who ever lived should have been, according to Clay,
a Frenchman, M. Deschapelles (born 1780, died
1847). He published in 1839 a fragment of a
"<cite>Traité du Whiste</cite>" which treats mainly of the laws,
and is of but little value to the Whist player.</p>

<p>Before leaving this historical sketch, a few words
may be added respecting the modern literature of the
game. So far as the present work is concerned, its
<i lang="fr">raison d'être</i> is explained in the preface to the first
edition. How far it has fulfilled the conditions of its
being, it is not for the author to say. It was followed,
however, by three remarkable books, which call for a
short notice.</p>

<p>In 1864, appeared "Short Whist," by J. C. (James
Clay). Clay's work is an able dissertation on the
game, by the most brilliant player of his day. He was
Chairman of the Committee appointed to revise the
Laws of Whist in 1863. He sat in Parliament for
many years, being M.P. for Hull at the time of his
death, in 1873.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1865, William Pole, F.R.S., Mus. Doc. Oxon,
published "The Theory of the Modern Scientific
Game of Whist," a work which contains a lucid
explanation of the fundamental principles of scientific
play, addressed especially to novices, but of considerable
value to players of all grades. In 1883, Dr. Pole
issued another volume, called "The Philosophy of
Whist." This is an essay on the scientific and intellectual
aspects of the modern game. It is divided
into two parts, "The Philosophy of Whist Play"
and "The Philosophy of Whist Probabilities," the
latter having been strangely neglected since the
publication of Hoyle's "Essay towards Making
the Doctrine of Chances Easy" (1754).</p>

<p>These books exhibit the game both theoretically and
practically, in the perfect state at which it has arrived
during the two centuries that have elapsed since Whist
assumed a definite shape and took its present name.</p>

<h2>PART I.<br />

GENERAL PRINCIPLES.</h2>


<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<p>Before entering on an analysis of the general
principles of the Game of Whist, it is advisable to
explain shortly on what foundation these principles
rest; for it might be supposed that a demonstration
of the propositions contained in these pages is about
to be offered; that the chances for and against all
possible systems of play have been calculated; and
that the one here upheld can be proved to be certainly
right, and all others certainly wrong. Such a view
would be altogether erroneous. The problem is far
too intricate to admit of being treated with mathematical
precision. The conclusion that the chances
are in favour of a certain line of play is not arrived
at by abstract calculation, but by general reasoning,
confirmed by the accumulated experience of practised
players. The student must not, therefore, expect
absolute proof. He must frequently be satisfied if the
reasons given appear weighty in themselves, and none
weightier can be suggested on the other side; and
also with the assurance that the method of play recommended
in this work is for the most part that which,
having stood the test of time, is generally adopted.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST HAND OR LEAD.</h3>


<p>The considerations that determine the most advantageous
card to lead at the commencement of a hand
differ from those which regulate the lead at other
periods; for, at starting, the Doctrine of Probabilities
is the only guide; while, as the hand advances, each
player is able, with more or less certainty, to draw
inferences as to the position of some of the remaining
cards. The number of the inferences, and the certainty
with which they can be drawn from the previous
play, constantly increase; hence it not unfrequently
happens that, towards the termination of a hand, the
position of every material card is known.</p>

<p>In treating of the lead, it will be most convenient to
begin by examining the principles which govern the
original lead. The application of these principles
will require to be somewhat modified in the case of
trumps, as will appear hereafter.</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h4>1. LEAD ORIGINALLY FROM YOUR STRONGEST
SUIT.</h4>


<p>The first question that arises is, Which is the
strongest suit? A suit may be strong in two distinct
ways. 1. It may contain more than its proportion of
<em>high</em> cards. For example, it may contain two or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
honours&mdash;one honour in each suit being the average
for each hand. 2. It may consist of more than the
average <em>number</em> of cards, in which case it is a
numerically strong or long suit. Thus a suit of four
cards has numerical strength; a suit of five cards
great numerical strength. On the other hand a suit
of three cards is numerically weak.</p>

<p>In selecting a suit for the lead, numerical strength
is the principal point to look to; for it must be borne
in mind that aces and kings are not the only cards
which make tricks; twos and threes may become
quite as valuable when the suit is <em>established</em>&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>,
when the higher cards of the suit are exhausted.
To obtain for your own small cards a value that does
not intrinsically belong to them, and to prevent the
adversary from obtaining it for his, is evidently an
advantage. Both these ends are advanced by choosing
for your original lead the suit in which you have the
greatest numerical strength; for you may establish a
suit of this description, while, owing to your strength,
it is precisely the suit which the adversary has the
smallest chance of establishing against you. A suit
that is numerically weak, though otherwise strong, is
far less eligible.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, you have five cards headed
by (say) a ten in one suit, and ace, king, and one
other (say the two) in another suit. If you lead from
the ace, king, two suit, all your power is exhausted as
soon as you have parted with the ace and king, and
you have given the holder of numerical strength a
capital chance of establishing the suit. It is true that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
this fortunate person <em>may</em> be your partner; but it is
twice as likely that he is your adversary, since you
have two adversaries and only one partner. On the
other hand, if you lead from the five suit, though your
chance of establishing it is slight, you, at all events,
avoid assisting your adversary to establish his; the
ace and king of your three suit, still remaining in
your hand, enable you to prevent the establishment of
that suit, and may procure you the lead at an advanced
period of the hand. This we shall find as we proceed
is a great advantage, especially if, in the course of
play, you are left with all the unplayed cards, or <em>long
cards</em>, of your five suit.</p>

<p>The best suit of all to lead from is, of course, one
which combines both elements of strength.</p>

<p>In opening a suit, there is always the danger of
finding your partner very weak, or of leading up to a
<em>tenace</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, the best and third best cards, or the
second best guarded) in the hand of the fourth player.
If you lead from a very strong suit, these dangers
are more than compensated for by the advantages just
explained; if your best suit is only moderately strong,
the lead is not profitable, but rather the reverse. If all
your suits are weak, the lead is very disadvantageous.
The hand, however weak, must hold one suit of four
at least, and this, if only headed by a ten or a nine,
should generally be chosen. Being unable to strike
the adversary, you take the best chance of not assisting
him.</p>

<p>It follows that a suit consisting of a single card is a
very disadvantageous one to lead from; yet no lead is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
more common, even among players of some experience.
The reason assigned in favour of this lead is the possibility
of making small trumps. But it is important
to observe, that you stand very nearly as good a
chance of making trumps by waiting for some one
else to open the suit. If the suit is opened by the
strong hand, your barrenness will not be suspected;
you will be able, if necessary, to win the second round,
while you will be free from the guilt of having sacrificed
any high card your partner may have possessed
in the suit, or of having assisted in establishing a suit
for the adversary. Again, your partner, if strong in
trumps, will very likely draw yours, and then return
your lead, imagining you led from strength. If,
indeed, he is a shrewd player, he will, after being
taken in once or twice, accommodate his game to
yours; but he can never be sure of the character of
your lead, and may often miss a great game by not
being able to depend upon you. If you have great
numerical strength in trumps, the evils of a single-card
lead are lessened; but in this case, as will
hereafter be shown, it is generally right to lead
trumps. In the opinion of the author, it may be laid
down as an axiom, that in plain suits (<em>i.e.</em>, in suits
not trumps) the original lead of a single card is in no
case defensible.</p>

<p>Many players will not lead from a strong suit if
headed by a tenace; preferring, for instance, to lead
from ten, nine, three, to ace, queen, four, two. They
argue, that by holding up the ace, queen suit, they
stand a better chance of catching the king. So far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
they are right; but they purchase this advantage too
dearly; for the probable loss from leading the weak
suit may be taken as greater than the probable gain
from holding up the tenace.</p>

<p><em>Which card of the strong suit should be led originally?</em>&mdash;The
key to this problem is furnished by the
remark, that it conduces to the ultimate establishment
of a suit to keep the high or commanding cards of it
in the hand that has numerical strength. In the suit
of your own choosing, you are presumably stronger
than your partner; it is therefore undesirable at once
to part with your high cards. Hence it is best, in
general, to lead the smallest. Your partner, actuated
by a desire to assist in establishing your strong suit,
will play his highest card to your lead (<em>see</em> Play of
Third Hand, p. 92), and, if he fails to win the trick,
will, at all events, force a higher card from the fourth
player, and so help to clear the suit for you. Another
reason in favour of leading the lowest is, that it increases
your chance of making tricks in the first two
rounds. For in the first round of a suit the second
hand generally puts on his smallest card, as will be
seen hereafter. If, therefore, you originally lead the
smallest, holding ace and others, the first trick will,
in all probability, lie between your partner and the
last player; and since there is no reason why the
fourth player should hold a better card than the third,
it is nearly an even chance that your partner wins the
trick. It is certain (bar trumping) that you win the
second round; therefore, if the suit is led this way,
it is about an even chance that you make the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
two tricks. But if you lead out the ace first, it is two
to one against your making the second trick, for the
adversaries have two hands against your partner's one,
and either may hold the king. A third reason for
leading the lowest of your suit is, that your partner
may prove utterly weak in it; and in this case it is
important that you keep a commanding card, to stop
the adversary from establishing it.</p>

<p>It follows, when you lead a small card originally,
that your partner should conclude you have led from
numerical strength.</p>

<p>There are three exceptions to the rule of originally
leading the lowest of a strong suit.&mdash;1. When you
lead from ace with four or more small ones. In this
case it is considered best to begin with the ace, lest it
should be trumped on the second round. 2. When
your suit contains a strong sequence, it is best to lead
one of the sequence, in order to prevent the adversaries
from winning the first trick with a very small card.
3. When you lead from a suit of more than four cards
(not headed by ace and not containing a strong
sequence), the fourth-best card is led, for reasons to be
afterwards explained. (<em>See</em> Appendix A, pp. <a href="#Page_281">281</a>-6.)</p>

<p>When you intend to lead from a sequence, the card
to be selected depends on the nature of the sequence,
namely, whether it is a <em>head</em> sequence or an <em>under</em>
sequence. By a head sequence is meant a sequence
of the highest cards of your suit, <em>i.e.</em>, of the cards
heading your suit; thus, such a suit as queen, knave
ten, six, contains a head sequence of queen, knave,
ten. Sequences that do not head your suit are under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
sequences; thus ace, queen, knave, ten, is an example
of an under sequence of queen, knave, ten. You
should&mdash;</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h4>2. LEAD THE HIGHEST OF A HEAD SEQUENCE</h4>

<p class="center">(<em>Except as specified in the Analysis of Leads, pp. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>-71</em>).</p>


<p>For, otherwise, your partner is uncertain where the
highest lies, and you and he may play two winning
cards where one would have sufficed. For instance,
if, with queen, knave, ten, you lead the ten, your
partner may put the king on it, but he certainly
would not on the queen. In addition to this, if there
is any <em>finessing</em> to be done in the suit, it can only be
by your partner. By finessing is meant playing an
inferior card though holding a higher one of the suit,
not in sequence with the card played. Thus, to continue
the illustration of the sequence of queen, knave,
ten. You lead the queen. Your partner has the ace
and others. He will not put it on, but will finesse by
playing his smallest card; and if the king lies to your
left, that card is completely hemmed in. Had you
led the ten, your partner would have put on the ace,
and the king have been freed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you lead from an under
sequence, you should lead the lowest, the reason being
that, in this case, you wish your partner to put on his
highest card. For example, with king, ten, nine,
eight, you should lead the eight and not the ten, as
if your partner's highest card is the knave, you wish
him to put it on that he may not afterwards block
your suit by retaining a commanding card of it. Or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
suppose your partner's best card is the queen, the lead
of the ten would probably induce him to finesse, and
thus give the adversary a chance of making the knave
the first round, and of retaining the ace in hand,
although you and your partner hold two honours in
the suit. If your partner puts on the queen, you are
still able to finesse the nine when the suit is returned,
and this is much more advantageous than your partner's
passing the ten. In the first place, the finesse is postponed
to the second round, when, more cards having
been played, you have more data to guide you as
to the policy of making the finesse; and, in the next
place, if you have a choice as to whether you or your
partner shall finesse in your strong suit, it is, as a rule,
more advantageous for you to do it. For, as already
explained, it conduces to the establishment of a suit
for the strong hand to retain the command of it, and for
the presumably weak hand to play his highest cards.</p>

<p>With sequences neither at the top nor at the
bottom of a suit (<em>intermediate</em> sequences), the card to
lead is the lowest of the intermediate sequence.</p>

<p>Players who adopt American Leads will, however,
select the fourth-best card when leading a low card
from suits of more than four cards, whether or not the
suit contains an under sequence, or an intermediate
sequence (with the sole exception of ten, led from
king, knave, ten, and small). Thus, from king, knave,
ten, nine, whether accompanied by the eight or by
smaller cards, they lead the nine; and so on for
other combinations. (<em>See</em> Appendix A, pp. <a href="#Page_281">281</a>-6).</p>

<h4>ANALYSIS OF LEADS IN DETAIL.</h4>

<p class="center">(<em>See</em> also Appendix A, pp. <a href="#Page_281">281</a>-6, and Appendix C, pp. <a href="#Page_289">289</a>-94.)</p>


<p>[The following analysis should be familiarly known by
every player, not only that he himself may follow it, but
also that he may form a correct idea of the cards the other
players hold, by observing what they lead.]</p>


<h5><em>Ace, king, queen, knave (in trumps).</em></h5>

<p>Lead knave, then ace.</p>

<p>With more than four in suit, lead queen after ace.</p>

<p>With only four in suit, lead king after ace.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, king, queen, knave (in plain suits).</em></h5>

<p>Lead king, then knave.</p>

<p>With more than four in suit, lead queen after
knave.</p>

<p>With only four in suit, lead ace after knave.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, king, queen, with or without small ones (in trumps).</em></h5>

<p>Lead queen.</p>

<p>With more than four in suit, lead king after queen.</p>

<p>With only four or three in suit, lead ace after queen.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, king, queen, with or without small ones (in plain
suits).</em></h5>

<p>Lead king, then queen.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, king, knave, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Lead king, then ace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes it is right, more especially in trumps, to
lead king, then to change the suit, and to finesse the
knave on the return, particularly if queen is turned up
to your right. With more than five trumps it is seldom
advisable to wait for the finesse. No positive rule
can be laid down, either for trumps or plain suits.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, king, and small (in trumps).</em></h5>

<p>Lead king, then ace, if you have at least five small
ones. Otherwise, lead a small one (the fourth-best if
an American Leader).</p>


<h5><em>Ace, king, and small (in plain suits).</em></h5>

<p>Lead king, then ace.</p>

<p>King is led before ace to inform your partner that
you hold the winning card of your suit, in case you
should think fit to change the suit, or in case the
fourth player should have none of it. If your partner
has none, he should not trump, for, even if you do not
hold the ace, you want the adversary to play it, that
he may not retain the winning card of your suit.</p>

<p>When opening a plain suit, headed by ace, king,
<em>after having been forced</em> to trump, lead the ace first.
If you begin with the king, and your partner happens
to have none of the suit, he might trump the king, in
order to lead again the suit you have already trumped.</p>

<p>If intermediate cards fall and you remain with the
command and the next best, you inform your partner
of the fact by continuing with the next best. Thus:&mdash;You
lead king from ace, king, knave, etc. To the
king, your partner drops the queen. You should next
lead the knave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>


<h5><em>Ace, queen, knave, ten, with or without others.</em></h5>

<p>Lead ace, then ten, even though one of your others
is the nine.</p>

<p>With more than four in suit, lead knave after ten.</p>

<p>With only four in suit, lead queen after ten.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, queen, knave, and small.</em></h5>

<p>Lead ace.</p>

<p>With more than four in suit, lead knave after ace.</p>

<p>With only four in suit, lead queen after ace.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, queen, ten, &amp;c. (in trumps).</em></h5>

<p>If knave is turned up to your right, lead queen.</p>


<h5><em>Ace and small ones (in trumps).</em></h5>

<p>Lead ace, if you have seven in suit, and then a
small one (the original fourth-best if an American
Leader).</p>

<p>Lead a small one (the fourth-best if an American
Leader), with less than seven in suit.</p>

<p>Obvious variations, taking into account the trump
card, are omitted. It is assumed, <em>e.g.</em>, that, if your
partner has turned up the king, you would lead a
small one from ace, queen, knave, &amp;c., or from ace
and any number of small cards.</p>


<h5><em>Ace and small ones (in plain suits).</em></h5>

<p>Lead ace, with five or more in suit.</p>

<p>Lead a small one after ace (the original fourth-best
if an American Leader).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Lead lowest, with only four in suit, the cards being
of a lower denomination than in the leads already
enumerated.</p>


<h5><em>King, queen, knave, ten, with or without others.</em></h5>

<p>Lead ten, even though one of your others is the
nine.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<em>a.</em>) If ten wins the trick:&mdash;</p>

<p>With more than five in suit, lead knave after ten.</p>
<p>With five in suit, lead queen after ten.</p>
<p>With only four in suit, lead king after ten.</p>


<p class="hangindent">(<em>b.</em>) If ten forces ace:&mdash;</p>

<p>With more than four in suit, lead knave after ten.</p>
<p>With only four in suit, lead queen after ten.</p>

<p>The common practice is (or was) to lead queen
after ten, in all cases, to inform your partner that the
lead was from king, queen, knave, ten, and not from
king, knave, ten. But, if the ten wins the trick, the
mere fact of continuing with a high card informs your
partner that the lead was from king, queen, knave,
ten; for, with the only other combination from which
ten is first led, (viz., king, knave, ten), if the ten
wins, the next lead is a small card.</p>

<p>If the ten forces the ace, and your partner can give
you credit for not leading a losing card when you
hold a winning one, he is informed, by the second lead
of any high card but the king, that you led from king,
queen, knave, ten. Therefore, queen and knave are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
high indifferent cards, and you select the knave to
show five or more originally; the queen to show four
exactly (<em>see</em> Appendix A).</p>


<h5><em>King, queen, knave, and more than one small.</em></h5>

<p>Lead knave.</p>

<p>With more than five in suit, lead queen after knave.</p>

<p>With only five in suit, lead king after knave.</p>


<h5><em>King, queen, knave, and one small one.</em></h5>

<p>Lead king, then knave.</p>

<p>If the king wins the first trick it is not safe to go
on with a small one, ace being sometimes held up by
the adversary, especially in trumps.</p>


<h5><em>King, queen, and small ones (in trumps.)</em></h5>

<p>Lead king, if you have seven in suit, or if one of
your small ones is the ten.</p>

<p>Lead a small one (the fourth-best if an American
Leader), with less than seven trumps, and not holding
the ten.</p>

<p>If king is led, and it wins, after king lead a small
one (the original fourth-best if an American Leader).</p>


<h5><em>King, queen, and small ones (in plain suits).</em></h5>

<p>Lead king.</p>

<p>If the king wins, after king lead a small one (the
original fourth-best if an American Leader).</p>


<h5><em>King, knave, ten, nine, with or without small ones.</em></h5>

<p>Lead nine, even though you also hold the eight.</p>

<h4>3. LEAD THE HIGHEST OF A NUMERICALLY
WEAK SUIT.</h4>


<p>When it is your fate to open a numerically weak
suit, your object should be to do as little harm as
possible. You cannot expect to win many tricks, so
you must do all you can to assist or <em>strengthen</em> your
partner by leading high or strengthening cards; for,
by leading the highest of a suit numerically weak, you
take the best chance of keeping the strength in your
partner's hand, should he happen to hold it.</p>

<p>You will not often be driven to open a weak suit
originally, as one of your suits must contain as many
as four cards. But it may so turn out that your four-card
suit is composed of very small cards indeed, in
which case you might prefer to open a suit containing
better cards, though numerically weaker. Every one
can see that ace, king, queen, is a better suit to open
than five, four, three, two; but, as you descend in one
scale and ascend in the other, there comes a point
where the two descriptions of strength nearly or quite
balance. With hands containing only a suit of four
small cards&mdash;say none higher than the seven or eight,
and suits of three cards of higher value&mdash;the choice is
sometimes difficult. Also, with hands in which your
only four-card suit is the trump suit, you might sometimes
deem it advisable to open one of the other suits,
as a smaller evil than leading a trump. As a rule,
when you are in doubt, stick to the general principle,
and lead from your four-card suit, even though it is the
trump suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever you decide on opening a suit of but
three cards, choose, if possible, one in which you hold
a sequence which may be of benefit to your partner,
as queen, knave, ten; queen, knave, and one small
one; knave, ten, and one other, and so on, and lead
the highest. If you have no sequence, lead from
your strongest weak suit. Thus, two honours not in
sequence, and one small one, is a better lead than ace
and two small ones, or king and two small ones.
These, again, should be chosen in preference to queen
and two small ones. When leading from a numerically
weak suit that contains ace, king, or queen, but no
sequence, if you have any indication from the previous
play that your partner is strong in the suit (as will be
explained in Section 4), lead the highest. But having
no guide as to his strength lead the lowest. You run
the risk of making your partner think you have led
from numerical strength; but, on the other hand, by
leading out the high card, you at once give up the
command of the suit, and, unless your partner has
strength in it (the chances being against this), you
leave yourself at the mercy of the opponents.</p>

<p>The case is different with numerically weak suits
headed by a knave or a lower card. Of these suits you
should lead the highest; by retaining such a card as the
knave you would scarcely ever be able to stop the adversaries
from establishing the suit, should they be strong
in it; and, by leading out the high card, you do all
you can to aid your partner, should he have strength.</p>

<p>Ace and one other, king and one other, or queen
and one other, are very bad suits to lead from. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
holding them up you and your partner stand a better
chance of making tricks in the suit; and if it should
be the adversaries' suit (the chances being two to one
that it is) you keep the power of obstructing it and of
obtaining the lead at advanced periods of the hand.
If you lead from ace, king only, lead ace, then king.</p>

<p>It follows that when you lead a high card in the
first round of a suit, and in the next drop a lower one
(subject to the rules respecting leads from sequences
and the lead from suits of five or more cards), your
partner should infer you have led from a weak suit.
Thus, suppose you lead a nine, which is called an
equivocal card, as it comes from both strong and
weak suits. If in the second round your partner
can infer that you hold a higher card, he knows you
have led from strength. But if in the second round
you lead (say) the eight, your partner may be equally
certain that the former card was the highest of your
weak suit.</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h4>4. AVOID CHANGING SUITS.</h4>


<p><em>When you obtain the lead after one or more tricks
have been played, the question arises whether or not you
should open a fresh suit.</em> If you have had the lead
before, it is generally advisable to pursue your original
lead, for you thus take the best chance of establishing
the suit, and you open a fresh suit to a disadvantage.</p>

<p>The fall of the cards in the previous rounds may
cause you to alter your game. Thus, the previous
play may have already established your suit, or may
have so nearly established it as to justify you in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
leading trumps, as hereafter explained; or your partner
may have shown a very strong suit, or a strong
trump hand, which may modify your game. Again,
your partner may prove utterly weak in your suit;
you would then often discontinue it, unless holding
the winning cards or a strong sequence, because,
with these exceptions, your continuing it gives the
adversary the opportunity of finessing against you,
and of cutting up your suit; or you may sometimes
discontinue a suit if you expect it will be trumped
(as will be further explained in Sections 13-16); but,
failing such indications, it is best, as a rule, to pursue
the original lead.</p>

<p>If you have not had the lead before, it is in most
cases advisable to open your strong suit, when you
possess <em>great</em> strength in any suit, for you open such
suit to advantage; but with weak or only moderately
strong suits, which you open to a disadvantage, you
would, as a rule, do better to return your partner's
original lead, or to lead up to the weak suit of your
right-hand adversary, or through the strong suit of
your left-hand adversary. When in doubt as to
opening your own suit or returning your partner's,
you should, as a general rule, be guided by your
strength in trumps. With a strong trump hand play
your own game; with a weak trump hand play your
partner's game.</p>

<p>If your partner has had a lead, and you are
thoroughly conversant with the system of leading
developed in Sections 2 and 3, and with the Analysis
of Leads (pp. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>-71), you know by the value of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
card he has led whether he is strong or weak in that
suit, unless he has led an equivocal card, which is led
from both strong and weak suits. In this case, if
you have no evidence from your own hand, or from
the fall of the cards, you presume, with a good
partner, that he has led from strength. But you
mostly have some evidence; for instance, if he leads
a ten originally, he has led from king, queen, knave,
ten; from king, knave, ten; or the highest of his
suit. If you hold&mdash;or either adversary plays&mdash;king
or knave, you know that your partner has led the
highest of his suit. But, in the absence of these
cards, and especially if the ten wins the first round,
or falls to the ace or queen, you may conclude that
your partner's lead was from strength, and you would
do perfectly right to return it.</p>

<p>When you have won the first trick in your partner's
lead cheaply, you must be cautious in returning it, as
the strength must be between your partner and your
right-hand adversary. For example, say A, Y, B, Z,
are the four players, and that they sit in this order
round the table, so that A leads and Z is last player.
If A leads a small card of a plain suit, Y plays a
small one, and B (third player) puts on his best card,
the queen, which wins the trick, it is clear that Z can
have neither ace nor king; A cannot have them both,
or he would have led one, therefore Y must have one
of them at least; and, if B returns the lead, he leads
up to Y's strength, and may cut up his partner's suit.</p>

<p>By observing the card led by either adversary, you
can similarly tell whether he has led from strength or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
weakness; so also you can judge from the card played
third hand by the adversary whether he is weak, it
being presumed that the third player puts on his
best. It is advantageous to lead up to a weak suit,
because you compel the second hand to put on a
high card, or give your partner the opportunity of
finessing. It is generally less advantageous to lead
through a strong suit, unless you are sure that
the second hand is not <em>very</em> strong, and that the
fourth hand is weak. Otherwise, by continuing the
suit, you may be establishing it for the adversary,
and getting rid of the command of it from your
partner's hand.</p>

<p>In discussing leads from weak suits it was supposed,
for the sake of convenience, that the leader had no
indication from the play to guide him. But in practice,
in by far the greater number of cases, weak suits are
opened late in a hand when inference from previous
play has given an insight into the strength or weakness
of the several players. Thus, you commence with
your strong suit; your partner fails to show any
strength in it. After several other tricks are played
you get the lead again, remaining with (say) king and
two others of your first lead. You do not wish to
take one of the guards from your king, and you do
not deem it advisable to lead a card which your
partner may be obliged to trump. You therefore
try another suit. By this time you know, either
by the adversaries' leads what their strong suits are,
or by the players' discards (<em>i.e.</em>, by the cards they
throw away when not able to follow suit,) what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
their weak suits are, as will be explained under
discarding. Guided by these indications, you make
choice of a suit for your second lead in which your
partner is probably strong, and under such circumstances
you would, as a rule, lead the highest of
the suit of your second choosing, if numerically weak
in it.</p>

<p>When you have led a strengthening card, and it
wins the trick, you can rarely do better than continue
with your next highest. For example: from queen,
knave, and three you lead the queen, which goes
round. It hardly requires to be stated that you
make the best use of your suit by continuing with
the knave. When your strengthening card does not
win, the course of the play is the only guide as to
whether you should continue the suit. The application
of the considerations advanced in this Section
will generally inform you where the strong and weak
suits lie, and you will act accordingly, giving your
partner his strong suit, or, if he has not shown
one, leading up to the weak suit of the right-hand
adversary, or through the strong suit of the left-hand
adversary.</p>

<p>It has several times been assumed that it is
advantageous to have the lead at advanced periods
of a hand; we now see one principal reason why
it is so. The leader knows by observation where
the strong and the weak suits lie, and he will
generally be able to make use of this knowledge
in assisting his partner, or in obstructing his opponents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>The principles explained in the preceding pages
apply mainly to the original lead, or to leads early in
a hand. They apply also to leads generally; but, at
advanced periods of the hand, and towards its close,
their application is frequently modified by inferences
from the previous play, and by the state of the score.
Examples of departure from the rules here laid down
will be presented in the illustrative hands.</p>

<p>In the second round of a suit&mdash;</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h4>5. RETURN THE LOWEST OF A STRONG SUIT,
THE HIGHEST OF A WEAK SUIT.</h4>


<p>When you return your partner's lead, the card you
should choose to lead the second round depends on
the number of cards of the suit you have remaining.
Thus, if you remain with three cards, you must have
had four at first. You therefore had strength in the
suit, and you should return the smallest of the three
remaining cards, agreeably to the principle that with
strength it is to your advantage to retain the command
in your own hand. If you remain with two cards
only, you should return the higher one, to strengthen
your partner; and, similarly, if you have discarded
one of a four-suit, and are left with two only <em>at the
time you return it</em>, you have destroyed the numerical
power of your suit, and should therefore treat it as a
weak suit, and return the higher card of the two
remaining in your hand.</p>

<p>The advantages of this principle are numerous. In
the case that you and your partner are both numerically
strong, the return of the lowest prevents him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
from finessing in a suit which must be trumped third
round. Further, if your hand is weak, you naturally
return a suit in which you infer that your partner is
strong. You then return a strengthening card to get a
high card of your partner's strong suit out of his way,
and you enable him to finesse if he thinks proper, and
so to keep the command of his suit in his own hand.</p>

<p>It is true that with two small cards only (say the
five and the six) you do not strengthen your partner
by returning the six. But there is a collateral advantage
in keeping to the rule even with small cards&mdash;<em>you
enable a good partner to calculate how many you
have left of the suit</em>, and often where the remainder of
it lies. Thus, your partner leads a small card of a
suit of which you have king, three, and two. You, as
third player, put on the king. If you return the suit,
you return the three, and not the two, when it ought
to be inferred, either that you have returned the
smallest of a suit of four or more, or that you have no
more of the suit left, or the two only. When your
two comes down in the third round it ought to be
certain that you have no more. If your partner has
confidence in you, he can often calculate what you
have left before the third round is played; thus, in
the above instance, your partner, not having the two
himself, and seeing that it does not drop from the
adversaries, concludes, with tolerable certainty, that
you remain, after the second round, with the two and
no more.</p>

<p>There are two exceptions to the rule of play above
stated: 1. When you hold the winning card you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
return it, whatever number of cards you hold, lest it
should be trumped the third round, or, your partner,
imagining it to be against him, should finesse; and
2. When you hold the second and third best, in plain
suits, you return the highest. Thus, suppose you
have queen, knave, ten, and one small one of a suit of
which your partner leads a small one, you (third hand)
put on the ten, which is won by (say) the ace. If
you afterwards return the suit, you should return the
queen, for you not only force out the king, if against
you, but you also do not block your partner's suit,
should he have led from great numerical strength, say
five cards to the nine, an advantage which you lose
by returning the small one.</p>

<p>It should also be observed that, occasionally, when
you return your adversary's strong lead, you do not
lead the higher of two remaining cards, especially if
you hold the second best guarded. For example, you
are A; Y is your left-hand adversary. Y has led a king,
which was won by the ace, leaving Y with the queen
and others. You remain with knave and one small
one. If you are driven to return this suit, you should
return the small one. The queen will probably be put
on second hand, and you will remain with the best.</p>

<h3>THE SECOND HAND.</h3>


<p>In the first round of a suit, you should generally,</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h4>6. PLAY YOUR LOWEST CARD SECOND HAND.</h4>


<p>You presume that the first hand has led from
strength, and, if you have a high card in his suit,
you lie over him when it is led again; whereas, if you
play your high card second hand, you get rid of a
commanding card of the adversary's suit, and, when
it is returned, the original leader finesses against you.
Besides this, the third player will put on his highest
card, and, if it is better than yours, you have wasted
power to no purpose.</p>

<p>If, however, you have a sequence of high cards, you
should put on one of the sequence second hand, for, if
you pass the trick altogether, the third hand may win
with a very low card, or, with his low card, may force
a high one from your partner. The chief objection to
playing an unsupported high card does not apply, as
the leader cannot successfully finesse against you in
the next round.</p>

<p>With a moderate sequence, such as queen, knave&mdash;knave,
ten&mdash;ten, nine&mdash;you play the lowest of the
sequence if you are numerically weak; but, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
more than three cards of the suit, you pass a small
card led, agreeably to the principle already discussed&mdash;that
in weak suits you play to strengthen
your partner, but in strong ones you leave him to
help you. For instance: the leader (A) has king,
ten, nine, eight, seven of a suit; the second player
(Y) has queen, knave, and one small one; the fourth
player (Z) has ace and two small ones. A leads a
small card; Y should play the knave; if he does not,
the card led forces Z's ace. It is true that this
happens also if Y passes with queen, knave, and two
small ones; but Y, in this case, has a guard to his
queen and knave, and is left with the two winning
cards after the second round of the suit.</p>

<p>With a sequence lower than ten, nine, there is no
advantage in putting on one of the sequence; so the
lowest should then be played second hand, in conformity
with the general principle.</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h4>7. PLAY THE LOWEST OF A SEQUENCE.</h4>


<p>When you do not head a trick, you throw away
your lowest card to economise your strength. Thus,
with queen and two small ones, you would not throw
the queen to king led. It is an error to suppose that
it is of no consequence which card you play when you
hold only small cards or cards in sequence. It is not
of much consequence as regards merely the chance of
making tricks; but it is of great importance in affording
information to partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, suppose the players to be as before, A, Y, B,
Z. A leads the three of a suit, Y plays the five, B
the four. It ought to be certain that B has no more
of the suit, it being presumed that he, not being able
to head the trick, throws away his smallest. If he
afterwards plays the two, and it turns out that he previously
played the four <em>through carelessness</em>, his partner
loses confidence, and gives up all hopes of drawing
correct inferences from his play.</p>

<p>The principle applies equally to cards in sequence.
Thus, say queen is led, and you (second hand) hold ace
and king; if you put on the king, your partner gains
the very important information that you have the ace
also. For queen is not led from ace, queen, &amp;c., so
the leader cannot have the ace; the third hand cannot
have it, or he would win the king; and the fourth, not
having it himself, infers that you have it. If you put
on the ace, not only could he not tell that you hold the
king, but would assume that it lay with the leader's
partner. The principle, though stated for the sake of
convenience in respect of the second hand, applies to
the third and fourth hands also. (For a fuller examination
of this point <em>see</em> Section 12.)</p>

<h4>ANALYSIS OF PLAY OF SECOND HAND
IN DETAIL.</h4>

<p class="center">(<em>See</em> Note on Analysis of Leads, p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>.)</p>


<h5><em>Ace, king, queen, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Play lowest of ace, king, queen sequence.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, king, knave, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Play king (but <em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_89">89</a>).</p>

<p>On the second round of the suit, it becomes a
matter of judgment whether you should play ace or
finesse knave. No positive rule can be laid down.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, king, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Play king.</p>

<p>In trumps it is sometimes right to pass, leaving the
chance of the first trick to your partner.</p>

<p>Obvious alterations on account of the trump card
are omitted. It is clear that, with ace, king, &amp;c., if your
partner has turned up the queen, you should play a
small one; and that, with ace, king, knave, if your
right hand adversary has turned up the queen, you
should play the knave; and so on for other cases.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, queen, knave, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Play lowest of queen, knave sequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>


<h5><em>Ace, queen, ten, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>In trumps, play ten, or with cards in sequence, the
lowest of the ten sequence.</p>

<p>In plain suits, if strong enough in trumps to lead
them, play ten, or lowest of sequence; if weak in
trumps, play queen (but <em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_89">89</a>).</p>

<p>With ace, queen, ten only, play ten, whether strong
in trumps or not.</p>


<h5><em>Ace, queen, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Small card led.</p>

<p>In trumps, play a small one.</p>

<p>In plain suits, with five in suit, play a small one if
strong in trumps; the queen if weak in trumps.</p>

<p>Knave led.</p>

<p>Play ace. It is useless to cover with the queen, as
the leader cannot hold the king (<em>see</em> Analysis of Leads).</p>

<p>These instructions assume ordinary original leads
from strength. If ace or queen is turned up, some
players lead knave, from king, knave, ten. If you
know this is the practice of your right hand adversary,
you should exercise your judgment as to covering with
ace or queen.</p>

<p>Also towards the close of a hand, knave might be
led from king, knave for various reasons, perhaps as
the best chance of saving or winning the game or a
point, or as a false card. No rule can be laid down
for such cases.</p>

<p>Ten or nine led.</p>

<p>Play queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>


<h5><em>Ace, knave, ten, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>In trumps, play ten, or with cards in sequence with
the ten, the lowest of the sequence.</p>

<p>In plain suits, play a small one.</p>

<p>The reason for the difference is that, in trumps a
small card may be led from king, queen, &amp;c.; but in
plain suits, not. Hence as, in plain suits, the king or
queen must be in the third or fourth hand, your
strength would be wasted by covering.</p>


<h5><em>Ace and small ones.</em></h5>

<p>Play a small one.</p>

<p>As before observed, the original lead of a small card
from strength is assumed.</p>

<p>If, after several tricks have been played, you
particularly want the lead, or you suspect the possibility
of a lead from a single card, or one trick is of
importance, you would often be right to play the ace.
Again, no rule can be laid down.</p>


<h5><em>King, queen, knave, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Play the lowest of the king, queen, knave sequence.</p>


<h5><em>King, queen, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Small card led.</p>

<p>Play queen.</p>

<p>In trumps it is sometimes right to pass, unless you
hold ten also, or only three in suit.</p>

<p>Knave led.</p>

<p>The usual practice is to cover with the queen. But,
it can be shown by calculation that, if the lead is from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
knave, ten, nine, and small, more is gained than lost,
in the long run, by passing.</p>

<p>The best lead from knave, ten, nine, &amp;c., is disputed;
and so also is the question of covering.</p>


<h5><em>King, knave, ten, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Play the lowest of the knave, ten sequence.</p>


<h5><em>Queen, knave, ten, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Play ten, or lowest of sequence.</p>


<h5><em>Knave, ten, nine, &amp;c.</em></h5>

<p>Play nine, or lowest of sequence.</p>

<p>Play as directed at pp. <a href="#Page_82">82</a>-3.</p>


<h5><em>Covering or passing second hand.</em></h5>

<p>If an honour is led, and you have the ace, as a rule
play the ace.</p>

<p>If an honour is led, and you hold an honour, not
the ace, pass as a rule.</p>

<p>It was formerly the practice to cover an honour with
an honour, if numerically weak. Calculation shows
more is gained than lost, in the long run, by passing.
But, if a strengthening card is led, late in a hand, it
would often be right to cover. No positive rule can
be laid down for the play of the second hand
under such circumstances. When you have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
<em>fourchette</em> it is almost always right to cover. Thus,
if knave is led, and you hold queen, ten, &amp;c., put
on the queen.</p>

<p>If a ten is led, and you hold queen and one small
one, play queen. The lead is probably from king,
knave, ten, &amp;c., and the queen may save your partner's
ace. With queen and two small ones, or with other
combinations not enumerated as those with which a
high card should be played second hand, pass.</p>

<p>If a nine is led, and you hold king and one small
one, play king. The leader must have opened an ace
suit (either ace, queen, ten, nine, or ace, knave, ten,
nine), assuming him to have led from a suit of four
cards. The same applies if you hold king, nine, and
eight is led.</p>

<p>If a medium card is led from a suit of at least four
cards, three being higher than the card led, and you
hold cards that (together with the leader's cards) make
up a sequence, cover with the lowest card you can.
For example:&mdash;The original lead is an eight. You
(second hand) hold ace, king, ten, with or without
small ones. If the lead was from queen, knave, nine,
eight, as is most probable, and the ten is put on, it
will win the trick.</p>

<p>Again: the original lead is a seven. You hold ace,
queen, knave, eight. If the seven is the lowest of a
four card suit, the lead must have been from king, ten,
nine, seven. Therefore, the eight put on will win the
trick.</p>

<p>The same applies, if the leader of an ace follows
with a medium card. For example:&mdash;Ace is led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
originally. The next lead of an American Leader is,
say, the eight. You had originally king, queen, ten,
four, and you played the four to the ace. The leader
must hold knave, nine and small. You should, therefore
play the ten. And, observe, the play would be
the same, if the second lead of a player who does not
follow the American system were the seven, as then he
must hold knave, nine, eight.</p>

<p>If a small card is led, and you hold an honour and
a small card, pass the trick as a rule; for by putting
on the honour you expose your weakness, and enable
the original leader to finesse against you on the second
round. The principal general exception to playing
a small card second hand, is when the circumstances
of the hand cause you to seize any chance of getting
the lead, as when you want to stop a lead of
trumps, or to lead trumps yourself. Then it is
often right to play a high card second hand, when
unsupported by another high card.</p>

<p>Also, in trumps, if king or queen is turned up, and
you hold it singly guarded (<em>i.e.</em>, if you have only one
other trump), it is generally advisable to put on the
turn-up, second hand. And if you hold king or queen,
singly guarded, and a superior honour is turned up to
your right, you should play the king or queen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the second round of a suit, if you have the
winning card, you should&mdash;in plain suits&mdash;generally
put it on second hand, subject to a finesse that will
certainly be successful; but in trumps there are many
cases in which you should not, especially if you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
numerical strength in trumps, and a good hand besides.
Your winning trump must make, and, by passing the
second round, you perhaps enable your partner to win
with a third best trump&mdash;or even a smaller one&mdash;yourself
retaining the command.</p>

<p>If, when led through in the second round of a suit,
you conclude from the previous fall of the cards that
the second best card is to your right, it is sometimes
advisable to put on the third best. You thus save
your partner's hand if he holds the best. For instance:
if knave is led in the first round, and your partner
(then second player) puts on king, which wins the
trick, it is clear (if the ten is your best) that your
partner has the ace, for the third player could not win
the king, and the leader could not have led from ace,
knave. If your right-hand adversary afterwards
returns the suit through you, you should put on the
ten in order to save your partner's ace.</p>

<h4>8. PLAY YOUR HIGHEST CARD THIRD HAND,</h4>


<p>in order to strengthen your partner. You presume
that he leads from his strong suit, and wants to get
the winning cards of it out of his way; you, therefore,
do not finesse, but play your highest, remembering
that you play the lowest of a sequence.</p>

<p>With ace, queen (and, of course, ace, queen, knave,
&amp;c., in sequence) you do finesse, for, in this case, the
finesse cannot be left to your partner. In trumps you
may finesse ace, knave, if an honour is turned up to
your right. Some players finesse knave with king,
knave, &amp;c.; but it is contrary to principle to finesse in
your partner's strong suit.</p>

<p>If your partner leads a high card originally, you
assume it is led from one of the combinations given
in the Analysis of Leads (pp. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>-71), and your play
third hand must be guided by a consideration of the
combination led from. With ace, you pass queen led;
you are then in much the same position as though a
small card were led, and you finessed with ace, queen.</p>

<p>Knave, led originally, is from king, queen, knave, &amp;c.
(some players lead knave from knave, ten, nine, &amp;c.)
In either case, if you hold ace with one small card,
play the ace; with more than one small card, pass
(<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_98">98</a>). If your only honour is the king, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
should pass knave led. For, the second hand having
passed, you assume ace to be to your left (p. <a href="#Page_88">88</a>).
Should the queen be there also, you waste the king by
covering; and if queen is to your right, the knave
forces the ace.</p>

<p>Ten may be led originally from king, queen, knave,
ten, or from king, knave, ten, &amp;c. If you hold ace,
you should put it on; but if you hold queen, you
should pass. Holding both ace and queen, your play
depends on whether you wish to obtain the lead on
the first round of the suit.</p>

<p>If your partner opens a suit, late in a hand, with a
high card, your play, third hand, will depend on your
judgment of the character of the lead. If it is probable
that your partner has led from a weak suit, you will
often be right to finesse king, knave, &amp;c., or to pass his
card altogether, so as not to give up the entire command
of the suit. Thus, if ten is led and you hold ace, knave,
&amp;c., it is clear that the card led is the highest your
partner holds in the suit. You therefore pass, and unless
both king and queen are to your left, you remain
with the tenace. Similar remarks apply to a forced lead
of knave, when you hold ace, ten, &amp;c. If you have considerable
strength in a suit in which a strengthening
card is led, you must be guided by your strength in
trumps. Thus, your partner leads knave from a weak
suit, and you hold ace, king, and small ones. You
may, as a rule, pass the knave if you are strong in
trumps, but not if weak.</p>

<p>In the second round of a suit, if you (third player)
hold the best and third best cards, and you have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
indication as to the position of the intermediate card,
your play should again depend on your strength in
trumps. If weak in trumps, secure the trick at once;
if strong in trumps, and especially if strong enough to
lead a trump (<em>see</em> Management of Trumps, pp. <a href="#Page_120">120</a>-24),
should the finesse succeed, it is generally right to
make it. If you hold second and fourth best, you
may nearly always finesse; for you conclude that the
winning card is over you in the fourth hand, since your
partner has not led it, and the second player has not
put it on. If the third best lies over you also, you
cannot prevent the tenace from making, and your only
chance, therefore, is to finesse. Thus, if you lead a
small card from queen, ten, and two small ones, your
partner wins the first trick with the king, and returns
a small one. The ace is certainly to your left; you
therefore finesse the ten, for if your left-hand adversary
holds ace and knave he must make them both; but,
otherwise, your ten forces the ace, and you are left
with the best. In trumps, the winning card is often
held up by the adversary, but you must submit to this
contingency, and generally finesse.</p>

<p>It is of no use to finesse against your right-hand
adversary in a suit in which he has shown weakness.
For instance, if the second hand has none of the suit
led, and does not trump it, you (third hand) should not
finesse a major tenace (<em>i.e.</em>, the best and third best cards).
This often occurs in the second or third round of a suit;
also, if your partner (third player) has won a trick very
cheaply, and the suit is returned, it is rarely of any use
to finesse if you have the winning card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>In some few positions, however, it is necessary to
finesse, even if the second player holds nothing. Thus,
your partner leads a knave, and the second hand renounces
(<em>i.e.</em>, does not follow suit); if you (third
player) hold king, it is useless to cover, as ace, queen
in the fourth hand must make. Again, you have king,
and two small trumps; your partner leads a small one;
the second hand renounces. If you want one trick to
win or save the game, you (third player) play a small
trump, when the fourth player will be obliged to lead
up to your king guarded.</p>

<p>The state of the game and of the score will often
direct as to a finesse late in a hand. Thus, if you
hold a winning card, and want one trick to save or
win the game, of course you should not run any risk.
A finesse against even one card is generally wrong, if,
by playing otherwise, you prevent the adversary from
scoring three or five. A finesse is almost always bad, if
by not finessing you insure the odd trick, as that makes
a difference of two to the score. In the opposite case,
a finesse is generally right (sometimes even against
more than one card), if its success gives you the odd
trick, or puts you at the score of three or five.</p>

<p>The considerations as to finessing and the course of
play generally, that come in as the hand proceeds, are
so complicated, and depend so much on inferences from
previous play, and on the state of the score, that one
can scarcely do more than to state a few broad rules,
and to add some examples. Illustrations of the conduct
of the hand at advanced periods will be found in Sections
17 and 18 (pp. <a href="#Page_134">134</a>-155), and more in the hands.</p>

<h3>THE FOURTH HAND.</h3>


<p>The fourth player having, with a few exceptions,
merely to win the trick, if against him, his play
involves no further development of general principles.</p>

<p>The exceptional cases, where the fourth hand should
not win the trick though he can, or should win his
partner's trick in order to get the lead, depend so
much on the previous fall of the cards, that they can
best be illustrated in the hands.</p>

<h4>THE COMMAND OF SUITS.</h4>

<p class="center">(<em>See</em> also Appendix B., pp. <a href="#Page_287">287</a>-8.)</p>


<p>In the foregoing chapters it has been incidentally
stated that you should</p>


<h5>9. KEEP THE COMMAND OF YOUR ADVERSARY'S
SUIT: <span class="smcap">AND</span><br />

10. GET RID OF THE COMMAND OF YOUR
PARTNER'S SUIT.</h5>

<p>The reasons will be obvious to those who are
familiar with the previous pages; in the first case,
you obstruct the adversaries' suits, and prevent their
establishing them; in the second case, you assist in
clearing the suit for your partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, with ace and queen only of a suit led by your
partner, if you win with the queen, play out the ace at
once; but, if the suit is led by your adversary, keep
the ace in your hand. If you play out the winning
card of the opponent's suit in hopes of trumping the
next round, which is often done by those who play a
trumping game, you do just what the adversaries
want; for the lead of the ace gives them valuable
assistance towards bringing in their suit when trumps
are out.</p>

<p>Though the advantage of getting rid of the command
of a suit, of which your partner has declared numerical
strength, is recognised theoretically, the application of
the principle is much neglected in practice. In order
to get rid, at the proper moment, of the command of
your partner's suit, a thorough knowledge of the
Analysis of Leads is requisite, as the following examples
will show:&mdash;1. Your partner leads ace, originally, of
a plain suit. He has led from ace, queen, knave, &amp;c.,
or from a suit of five cards at least. You have four of
the suit, say ten, nine, eight, two. To his ace, you
should play the eight, not the two. All follow suit,
and your partner continues with knave, or with a small
card. You now know for certain that he led from
five at least. You should play the nine, even if the
second hand puts on a winning card or a trump.
When the suit is led again, you should play the ten.
Your partner is left with two small cards, and you do
not block his suit; if you had played two, eight, nine,
it is very probable that you would keep the command
of the suit with the ten. 2. If instead of ten, nine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
eight, two, you held, say, ten, nine, three, two, and
your partner leads ace and a small one, you should
similarly play the nine on the second round. 3. If
your partner led from ace, queen, knave and one
small one (as you will be informed by his leading
queen after ace), you cannot block the suit; but, if
you have played the eight to the ace, as in Example 1,
you must still play the nine to the queen, or you
have called for trumps (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>). You lose
nothing by this, as you and your partner still retain
the winning cards of the suit. If on the third round
you find it necessary to play your small card, you
have not called for trumps (<em>see</em> Appendix B,
pp. <a href="#Page_287">287</a>-8). 4. Similarly, you have king, queen,
and two small cards of a plain suit of which your
partner leads ace and a small one. All follow suit
to the ace; the second hand trumps the small one.
You should play the queen, and to the third round
the king. 5. Your partner leads knave of a plain
suit originally, from king, queen, knave, and at least two
small cards. The second hand plays a small card. You
(third hand) hold ace, &amp;c. Whether or not you should
put on the ace, depends on the number of small cards
you hold. Having only one small card, you should play
the ace, that you may not block the suit. Having more
than one small card, you pass the knave. Suppose
the knave wins the trick, and your partner continues
with king or queen. If you now remain with ace and
one small card, you should put on the ace; but, if
you have ace and two small cards left, you should
pass again, as you still have the power of getting rid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of the command on the third round. 6. To continue
the previous example. Say the two rounds of your
partner's suit have resulted in the fall of seven cards
of it, and that you still have ace and a small one left.
Your adversary now leads the suit a third time, that
his partner may trump it. You should play the ace,
keeping the small card of the suit of which your
partner will still hold two cards. 7. If your
partner leads a small card of a plain suit originally,
and you can tell from the fall of the cards that the
card led was not his absolute lowest, you know he led
from a suit of more than four (<em>see</em> Analysis of Leads),
and if you had four originally, you should be prepared
to get rid of the command on the subsequent rounds.
For example:&mdash;Your partner leads eight. All follow
suit, and the queen falls. On obtaining the lead
again, your partner leads the six, showing that he
led from at least five cards. Ace comes out. One
adversary does not follow suit. You held, originally,
knave, five, four, three, and have played the three and
the four. Your partner now has the lead again, and
leads the king of his suit. You, holding knave and
one small one, would play very badly to retain the
knave. You should throw the knave on the king,
and your partner's suit is freed. 8. Your hand
contains four cards, viz., ace and one small spade
(spades not having been led), and two losing diamonds;
your partner has nothing but spades, of which he leads
the king. If you pass it you cannot make more than
two tricks, for the winning diamonds are against you
in one hand; but, if you win your partner's king, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
return the small one, and your partner has led from
king, queen, you still win two tricks, and get a chance
of making three or four.</p>

<p>A collateral advantage of playing as advised, is that a
good partner will often know how many of his suit you
still have in hand. Thus, he leads knave, which you
pass; he continues with queen, which you win. It
ought to be a certainty that you remain with one small
card of his suit and no more. If you pass again, it
should be equally certain, when your ace comes down
in the third round, that you have one small card of
the suit in hand. Again: your partner leads ace and
knave; knave is won by the adversary with the king.
You, holding ten, nine, eight, deuce, have played eight
and nine of the suit. If the winner of the trick does
not lead a trump, your partner would infer, with tolerable
certainty, that you remain with the deuce and ten
of his suit, as no one is asking for trumps (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>)
and no one has played the deuce in two rounds.</p>

<p>In trumps, the case is somewhat different, as you
cannot block your partner's trump suit. It is then only
advisable to get out of his way, if you see from the fall
of the cards that it is essential he should proceed with
trumps. Thus: with ace and one small trump you would
not put ace on his knave led, unless very desirous of
three rounds of trumps immediately. Moreover, in
trumps, your partner can count your hand in another
way; for with four trumps you would echo, as will be
fully explained under Management of Trumps (p. <a href="#Page_128">128</a>).</p>

<p>You help your partner to get rid of the command
of your suit by leading the lowest of a sequence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
notwithstanding that it heads your suit, when you
want him to win your card if he can. For this reason
you lead ten from king, queen, knave, ten; ace, knave
from ace, queen, knave, and at least two small cards;
and so on. In this last case, if your partner has king,
whether he should put it on your knave, or not,
depends on how many small cards of the suit he holds.
If, when you lead knave, he remains with king and
one small one, he should win the knave with the king;
but if he has king and two small ones remaining, he
should pass the knave, for precisely the same reasons
as those given in the previous examples. Again,
suppose you are left with knave, ten, and others of a
suit, of which your partner can only have king and
another (ace and queen being out), though it is uncertain
whether he does hold the king. You would
cause him to get rid of the king by leading the ten;
whereas, if you led the knave, he probably would not
part with the king.</p>

<p>Experienced players frequently endeavour to steal a
trick, or to obtain the entire command of a suit (<em>i.e.</em>, to
keep a sufficient number of winning or commanding
cards in it to make every trick), by <em>underplaying</em>.
Underplay is keeping up the winning card, generally
in the second round of a suit, by leading a low card,
though holding the best.</p>

<p>Thus, suppose a small trump is led, and you (fourth
player) hold ace, knave, and two small ones, and you
win with one of the small ones. If, at a later period
of the hand, you return a small trump, you will very
likely cause your left-hand adversary to believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
your partner has the ace; consequently, if your left-hand
adversary has the king, he may not put it on;
your partner will win the second round with the queen,
and you will retain the command of the trump suit.</p>

<p>Underplay is an extempore stratagem depending on
observation of the previous fall of the cards, and,
therefore, best capable of explanation by examples.
Thus: A, finding his partner strong in trumps, leads
the seven. The king is put on by Y (second hand),
which B (third hand) wins, holding ace, queen, ten,
nine, eight. It is evident to B that A's seven was his
highest trump, as the only higher one in is the knave,
and A would never lead the seven from knave, seven.
The king having been put on second hand, B concludes
that Y, in all probability, holds at most one small
trump more. The knave is, to a moral certainty, in
Z's hand. B, by leading the eight in the second
round, will probably win the trick, and unless Z had
four trumps originally, will catch the knave with the
queen in the third round. (Further examples of underplay
occur in the hands.)</p>

<p>Players should be on their guard against this
manœuvre, particularly when second hand, in the
second round of a suit, they hold the second best
card guarded, and the adversary has been playing a
strong game (as by leading trumps), and is left with
the long trump, or is certain to be able to obtain the
lead again. Then it is often right for the second
hand to stick on a singly-guarded second best card,
especially if that is the only chance of making it. In
the case stated in the previous paragraph, Z's only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
chance of making the knave, if singly guarded, is to
put it on second hand. For, if the queen with small
ones is in A's hand, A is sure to finesse on the return
of the suit by his partner. Again, take this case: A
leads the six of diamonds; Y, with knave, ten, and a
small one, puts on the ten; B plays the king, and Z
wins it with the ace. Presently, A obtains the lead
again, and leads the eight of diamonds. A, having
led the lowest of his suit in the first round, it may be
inferred that he has led from a strong suit&mdash;headed in
this case by the queen&mdash;and that he is underplaying
with, probably, queen and nine in his hand. Y should
observe this, and in the second round should win the
eight with the knave.</p>

<p>Refusing to play the winning card in the first and
second rounds of a suit&mdash;commonly called <em>holding up</em>&mdash;is,
in fact, a species of underplay. For example:&mdash;1.
Trumps are led by the player to your left; the
third player wins with the ace, and returns the suit
through your hand. If you are left with king and
one or more small ones, you should play a small one,
unless the circumstances of the hand are such that
you deem it advantageous to stop the trump lead.
The original trump leader, not knowing but that the
king is in your partner's hand, will probably finesse,
and your partner thus has a chance of making the
third best trump, even though unguarded. If your
partner has neither second nor third best trump, no
harm is done, as you will then probably make but
one trick in the suit, however you play. 2. Again,
ten tricks are played, and each player is left with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
three cards of a suit not opened. If the second
player puts on the queen (from which it may be
inferred that he holds the king also), the third hand
should not cover with the ace. For, by winning the
trick, he must lead up to king guarded; but, by
passing it, he leaves the lead with the second player,
and takes the best chance of making two tricks.
3. One more example will suffice: A has the last
trump, and ace, ten, and three small cards of a suit
not led. The adversary now leads the king, and
follows with the queen of that suit. A should pass
them both; by so doing he will probably make three
tricks in the suit if the cards are equally divided.</p>

<h4>DISCARDING.</h4>


<p>When you cannot follow suit, you should</p>


<h5>11. DISCARD FROM YOUR WEAKEST SUIT.</h5>

<p>You weaken a suit by discarding from it, and lessen
the number of long cards you might otherwise establish
and bring in (<em>i.e.</em>, make tricks with if trumps are
out, and you obtain the lead after the establishment
of your suit). On the other hand, you do but little
harm by throwing from a suit in which you are already
weak. Your partner should understand that your first
or <em>original discard</em> is from your <em>weakest suit</em>, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
he understands that your original lead is from your
strongest suit.</p>

<p>But, as in the case of leads, you are sometimes
obliged to lead from a weak suit, or to make a forced
lead, so sometimes you have to make a <em>forced discard</em>.
Forced discards require much more careful consideration
than they generally receive.</p>

<p>It is clear that if the opponents declare great
strength in trumps (by leading trumps or asking for
them, as will be fully explained in Section 13), that
your chance of bringing in a suit is practically <em>nil</em>.
You should therefore, in such cases, abandon the
tactics you would otherwise adopt, and play to guard
your weaker suits, by discarding from your best protected
suit, which is generally your longest suit. You
must, in fact, play a defensive game.</p>

<p>If this system of discarding is comprehended by the
two players who are partners, it follows, as a matter of
course, that <em>when trumps are not declared against you,
your partner will assume you are weak in the suit you
first discard</em>; but, <em>when trumps are declared against
you, he will give you credit for strength in the suit from
which you originally throw away</em>. This is most important,
as it affects his subsequent leads. In the
first case, he will refrain from leading the suit from
which you have discarded; in the second, he will,
unless he has a very strong suit of his own, select for
his lead the suit in which you have shown strength by
your discard.</p>

<p>It is commonly said, "Discard from your strong suit
when the adversary leads or calls for trumps." But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
this is a very imperfect and misleading aphorism. If
you have no indications from the play, and are obliged
to discard to an adverse trump lead or call, you should
discard from your best protected suit. But, if you
have, or if the fall of the cards shows that your
partner has, sufficient strength in trumps to outlast
the adversary, the discard should be from the weak
suit. Thus: Y, second player, calls for trumps (<em>see</em>
p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>), and B, third player, also calls. The discards
of A and Z should be from their weak suits. For
though, on the one hand, great strength in trumps is
declared against them, on the other hand great
strength is also declared with them. Again: Z
deals and turns up nine of clubs. A (the original
leader) leads a small club; Y follows suit; B puts on
ace; Z plays king. This shows that Z has a sequence
of queen, knave, ten, nine of trumps; and therefore
that, though A has led a trump, he has anything but
the command of the suit. B returns the trump; Z
wins; Y has no more trumps. His discard should be
from his weakest suit. The following case is less
easy:&mdash;The adversary (A) leads a tierce major in
trumps, eleven trumps come out, and your partner
(Y) must have knave of trumps to save the game.
You now credit your partner with the command of
trumps, though the adversary has led them; and if
either you (Y) or your partner (Z) has to discard, the
discard should be from the weakest suit (<em>see</em> Hand
XII.) Similar remarks apply if a strengthening trump
is led by an adversary from weak trumps and good
cards in plain suits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that it is only your
original discard which is directive. Having once discarded,
you cannot undo your work by any number
of discards from another suit. Also, having once led
a suit, you have declared strength in it; and subsequent
discards from that suit do not alter the fact that
it was originally your strongest suit.</p>

<p>It is dangerous to unguard an honour, or to blank
an ace; and, also, to discard a single card when the
game is in an undeveloped stage, as it exposes your
weakness almost as soon as the suit is led. But,
when you see that there is a probability of strength
in trumps on your side, direct your partner to your
strong suit by all the means in your power, and
unhesitatingly unguard an honour, or throw a single
card. Of course, if strength in trumps is against
you, these are the very last cards you should think of
throwing away.</p>

<p>When your left-hand adversary will have the lead
next round, if you discard from a suit in which you
hold a tenace, you may possibly induce him to lead
that suit up to you. You must be on your guard
against this ruse, and not necessarily lead up to the
discard of your right-hand opponent.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to trumping as to discarding.
The weaker you are in trumps, the better it
is for you to make a little one by trumping, as will be
further explained in Section 14.</p>

<h4>THE CONVERSATION OF THE GAME.</h4>


<h5>12. AFFORD INFORMATION BY YOUR PLAY.</h5>

<p>It has several times been assumed in the preceding
pages that you should convey information by your
play. The question naturally arises, <em>How is it that a
player gains any advantage by publishing information
to the table?</em> It is often argued, and with much show
of reason, that as almost every revelation concerning
your hand must be given to the whole table, and that
as you have two adversaries and only one partner, you
publish information at a disadvantage. No doubt this
argument would have considerable force if you were
compelled to expose the whole of your hand. But
you possess the power, to a great extent, of selecting
what facts shall be announced and what concealed.</p>

<p>Experienced players are unanimous in admitting
that it is an advantage to inform your partner of
strength in your own suits, though some advise concealment
of strength in suits in which the adversaries
have shown strength. Thus, with ace, king, second
hand, the usual play is to put on the king. The third
hand does not win the king, and hence the leader is
able to infer that the ace of his strong suit is against
him. But, if you put on the ace second hand, you
prevent the leader from discovering where the king of
his suit lies. It is, however, found that two honours
in the adversary's suit constitute sufficient strength to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
make it advantageous in the long run to proclaim
your force; while, with less strength, it is not easy to
mystify the opponents prejudicially; so that, on the
whole, it seldom happens that a balance of gain results
from the adoption of deceptive play.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, a false card may be played
with a special object. For instance: ace is turned up
to your right, and, when the dealer gets in, he leads a
small trump. If you, second hand, have king, queen
only, you would be justified in playing the king, in
hopes of inducing the trump leader to finesse on the
return of the suit. Or, take this case: your left-hand
adversary leads originally the five of his strong suit,
from king, ten, seven, five. Your partner plays the
six; third hand plays ace. You, holding queen, knave,
nine, eight, four, three, play the three. Your right-hand
opponent now leads trumps; all the trumps come
out. The player to your right next returns the deuce
of his partner's suit. The original lead being from a
four-card suit, king, ten, seven, remain in the leader's
hand. If you play knave, the original leader will
place queen in your hand, and will hesitate to go
on with the suit. But, if you play queen, he will put
knave and at least one small one in his partner's
hand. Then if, under this impression, he continues
the suit, you bring it in.</p>

<p>It is in most cases unquestionably disadvantageous
to you that the whole table should be aware of your
being very weak in a particular suit, and, consequently,
information of weakness should be withheld as long as
possible. If you are led up to fourth hand in such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
suit, or if your partner opens the suit with a small
card, of course the disclosure is inevitable; but until
one of these events happens your poverty can generally
be kept out of sight. It may happen that you are
occasionally forced to lead a weak suit yourself; and
in this event the least disadvantage, on the whole, is
to tell the truth at once, by first leading the highest
of it. Your partner apprised of the state of your
hand, by the fall of your smaller card in the subsequent
round, will probably deem it prudent to strive
by defensive tactics to avert total defeat in that suit,
rather than to contend single-handed against the
combined strength of the opponents. But, at critical
points of the game, it is often right to conceal
weakness. Thus, towards the end of a hand, it is
necessary that your partner should make a couple
of tricks in an unopened suit, of which you hold two
or three little cards. You should lead the lowest. If
you lead the highest, the adversaries will suspect your
weakness at once, and will be sure of it on the second
round. Their efforts will then be directed to preventing
your partner from making the required tricks
in that suit. Your left-hand adversary will not
finesse; and if your partner is led through, your
right-hand adversary merely covers, or plays the lowest
card he has, higher than the one you first led.</p>

<p>When your partner has exhibited weakness in one
or more suits, you would frequently be justified in
playing a false card. You are driven to rely solely on
yourself, and are entitled to adopt every artifice your
ingenuity can suggest in order to perplex the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
side. The consideration that you may mislead your
partner will no longer influence you, as you know him
to be powerless for good or for evil.</p>

<p>You inform your partner by following the recognised
practice of the game, as by leading from your strong suit
originally, by leading the highest of a sequence, by following
suit with the lowest of a sequence, and so forth.
If you adhere to this you will soon acquire a reputation
for playing a straightforward intelligible game; and
this character alone will counterbalance the disadvantage
which will sometimes attach to the fact that you
have enabled the adversaries to read your hand. If
your partner knows that you play at random and
without method, he will be in a state of constant uncertainty;
and you almost preclude him from executing
any of the finer strokes of play, the opportunities for
which generally arise from being able to infer with
confidence the position of particular cards. The extreme
case of two skilled players against two unskilled
ones amounts almost to this, that towards the close of
a hand the former have the same advantage as though
they had seen each other's cards, while the latter have
not.</p>

<p>It follows that when you are unfortunately tied to
an untaught partner, especially if at the same time you
are pitted against observant adversaries, you should
expose your hand as little as possible, particularly in
respect of minor details.</p>

<p>It will become apparent, on consideration, that the
question of the advisability of affording information is
more or less intimately connected with every card that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
is played. It is, therefore, of extreme importance to
ascertain whether the practice is advantageous or the
reverse. The arguments just adduced are doubtless
in favour of the practice of affording information by
the play; but it must be admitted that by far the
strongest authority for it is that experienced players,
by their settled opinions, reject the opposite course.</p>

<p>The instructed player frequently selects one card in
preference to another with the <em>sole</em> object of affording
information. When the principle is carried thus far,
the play becomes purely conventional. For example:
you naturally win a trick as cheaply as possible; if,
fourth hand, you could win with a ten, you would not
waste an ace. But suppose you hold knave and ten,
which card should then be played? The knave and
ten in one hand are of equal value, and therefore to
win with the knave would be no unnecessary sacrifice
of strength. Nevertheless, you extend to such cases
the rule of winning as cheaply as possible, and you
play the ten for the mere purpose of conveying information.
This is a simple instance of pure convention.
Again: the system of returning the higher of two
losing cards (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>) when they are both small
cards, is purely conventional. To take another case:
after two rounds of your four-card suit, you are left
with two losing cards, say the six and the seven, and
you, having the lead, are about to continue the suit;
you should lead the six, not the seven, in accordance
with the rule that you lead the lowest card of a suit,
except with commanding strength. This being the
convention, if you lead the seven, your partner will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
infer that you cannot hold the six, and will suppose
that you led from a three-card suit, in consequence of
exceptional circumstances; if he is a good player he
will miscount all the hands, probably to your mutual
discomfiture.</p>

<p>Whist conventions, it will be observed, are in
accordance with, and are suggested by, principle.
Indeed, all the established conventions of the game
are so chosen as to harmonise with play that would
naturally be adopted independently of convention. The
aggregation of the recognised rules of play, including
the established conventions, constitute what in practice
is called the Conversation of the Game of Whist.</p>

<p>It must not be overlooked that unsound players
often deceive unintentionally, and all players sometimes
with intention. It is, therefore, necessary to be on
your guard against drawing inferences too rigidly.</p>

<p>There are some ways of conveying information
which have not been explained. For example: if you
have the complete command of a suit, you can publish
the fact by discarding the highest of it; the presumption
being that you would never throw away a winning
card with a losing one in your hand. If you discard
a second-best card of a suit of which your partner does
not know you to hold a long sequence, you ought to
have no more of the suit, for with the best also you
would discard that, and with a smaller one you would
discard that. By winning with the highest, and
returning the lowest of a sequence (more especially
fourth hand), you show that you have the intermediate
cards. Thus, with ace, king, queen, fourth hand, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
you desire to continue the suit, and at the same time
to show that you still remain with the winning
card, you would win with the ace and return the
queen. Again, as long as you keep the turn-up card
in hand, your partner knows where it is; so, having
turned up a nine and holding the ten, trump with the
ten in preference. This rule, however, is liable to
exceptions. With very small trumps, of equal value,
trumping with the higher card may be mistaken for an
exhibition of four or five trumps; also, if you are weak
in trumps, and the adversaries have shown strength in
them, it is not advisable to keep the turn-up card;
for, if the adversaries know you have it in your hand,
they will draw it, whereas, if you play it, they may be
uncertain as to your holding another. If you open a
suit of ace, king only, it must be a forced lead. You
then adopt the rule of leading the highest of a
numerically weak suit, and first lead the ace. This
shows your partner (unless you have already been
forced, when you lead the ace before king for other
reasons), that you have no more of the suit. Also,
by leading the lowest of a head sequence of winning
trumps (subject, if an American Leader, to a selection
of card in order to show number), you convey
information. Thus, you lead a small trump, partner
plays queen, won with king. You remain with ace,
knave, ten. On obtaining the lead, you continue with
the ten, and, when it wins, you have shown two by
honours (unless ace is held up, which is unlikely). If
you continue with ace, as in plain suits, your partner
can tell nothing about the knave and ten. You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
pursue the same method in plain suits when your
partner has no more trumps, and with any head
sequence when you want him to win the trick, or are
sure he cannot, and also when the fourth hand has
already renounced in the suit led.</p>

<p>A most valuable mode of conveying very precise
information of strength is within the reach of players
who think fit to adopt <em>American Leads</em> (<em>see</em> Appendix
A). As the propriety of these leads is questioned by
some players, it may be stated that they form a
beautiful system which is in full harmony with the
established principles of whist play.</p>

<p>With regard to the American system when leading
a high card of your strong suit after a high card, no
one disputes the propriety of leading ace, then queen,
from ace, queen, knave, and one small card; and of
leading ace, then knave, from ace, queen, knave, and
more than one small card. In the case of the four-card
suit, you select the higher card to tell your
partner not to play the king, as you have not sufficient
numerical power to defend the suit single-handed.
In the case of a suit of more than four cards, you
select the lower card that your partner may not retain
the command of your suit, and may play the king,
should he happen to have held king and two small
ones originally. For a similar reason, it is obvious
that with queen, knave, ten, and one small card, you
should follow queen with knave; with queen, knave,
ten, and more than one small card, you should follow
queen with ten.</p>

<p>Now, here is a germ of a principle of play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Holding two high indifferent cards, and only four of
your suit, your second lead is the higher card; holding
more than four, your second lead is the lower
card.</p>

<p>For the sake of uniformity, you should pursue the
same plan in all cases where, after your first lead, you
remain with two high indifferent cards. Thus, your
original lead is a ten, from king, knave, ten, and one
or more small cards. The queen is played to your ten.
You have the lead again, and it is immaterial, so far
as establishing the suit is concerned, whether you
proceed with the king or with the knave. But, if
your practice is uniform, and in accordance with the
practice which obtains in the case of ace, queen,
knave, and of queen, knave, ten, you can inform your
partner whether you led from a suit of four cards or
of more than four cards. If you continue with the
king, the higher of two indifferent cards, you led from
king, knave, ten, and one small card; if you continue
with the knave, the lower of two indifferent cards, you
led from king, knave, ten, and more than one small
card.</p>

<p>With regard to the American system, when opening
your strong suit with a low card, those who have
already adopted the <em>penultimate lead</em> from suits of five
cards, will have no difficulty in again discovering the
germ of a principle of play. The fourth-best card of
your suit is led from suits of four cards, and from
suits of five cards.</p>

<p>You have only to apply the same rule to suits of
more than five cards, and to lead your fourth-best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
card. You then pursue a uniform practice, and at the
same time convey valuable information. (<em>See</em> Appendix
A).</p>

<p>As an illustration, take this suit&mdash;queen, ten, nine,
eight. You lead the eight. Now suppose your suit
to be queen, ten, nine, eight, three. You still lead
the eight. Now add one more card. Your suit
is queen, ten, nine, eight, three, two. You should
still lead the eight. No doubt, a careful player would
lead the eight, as a card of protection, even if
American leads had never been thought of. With
lower cards, such as queen, nine, eight, seven, three,
two, it is possible a careful player might lead the
seven; and with still lower cards, where is he to stop?
The knot is cut by the very simple and uniform rule
of leading the fourth-best, without reference to the
possibility of its being a card of protection.</p>

<p>With regard to the lead of a high card followed by
a low card, when the American system is followed, the
low card selected should be the original fourth-best.
(<em>See</em> Appendix A).</p>

<p>The more the American system is examined, the
more thorough and perfect it will be found. Care,
however, must be taken, with leads late in a hand,
not to confuse a fourth-best lead with a forced lead of
the highest card of a weak suit. The American rule
only applies, in its integrity to the original lead,&mdash;or
after one or more tricks have been played, to the
original lead of the player's own choice, (<em>See</em> Appendix
A). Also, it may be, that the leader, with very
strong cards in all plain suits, starts by leading a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
strengthening trump. The uncertainty of the real
character of the lead, in this case, is no doubt
unfavourable; but, the advantage of frequently being
able to give information of great numerical strength
far outweighs this occasional danger.</p>

<p>Information as to the number of trumps you hold
can be similarly communicated when you have
more than four trumps, by trumping with the fourth-best
and then leading the fourth-best of those
remaining. This rule, however, is subject to rather a
large exception. When your fourth-best trump is a
medium card, such as an eight, trumping with the
eight may imperil a trick later on. For instance:
with such cards as king, knave, nine, eight, three, a
careful player would rightly trump with the three and
lead the eight. For the time, you do not inform your
partner as to number, because the eight is too
valuable a card to get rid of, and the information
might be purchased too dearly. Also, when about to
lead high trumps after a force, there is no occasion to
run any risk by trumping with any but the lowest, as
the high cards led will of themselves indicate how
many trumps you now hold (not how many you held
originally). If you take a force with any trump but
the lowest, and do not lead a trump, when your lowest
is afterwards played it only signifies that you had at
least five trumps originally, and your play does not
constitute a call for trumps. (<em>See</em> p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>.)</p>

<h4>THE MANAGEMENT OF TRUMPS.</h4>


<p>The Management of Trumps is, perhaps, the most
difficult of the problems presented to the Whist-player.
Before discussing the special uses of trumps,
it may be observed that in some few hands trumps are
led like plain suits, because they are your strongest
suit, and you prefer leading them to opening a weak
suit. The principles already discussed, which guide
us to the most favourable chances for making tricks
in a suit, apply to trumps equally with other suits.
The privilege, however, enjoyed by the trump suit of
winning every other, causes some modifications of detail
(noticed at pp. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>-71, and at pp. <a href="#Page_85">85</a>-88); for, since the
winning trumps <em>must</em> make tricks, you play a more
backward game in the trump suit. Thus, with ace,
king, and small trumps, you lead a small one, by
which you obtain an increased chance of making
tricks in the suit, and you keep the command of it,
and must have the lead after the third round, the
advantage of which will be presently explained. Even
if your partner is so weak in trumps that the opponent
wins the first trick very cheaply, but little (if
any) harm accrues; for the opponent then has to open
a suit up to you or your partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>In the great majority of hands, trumps are applied
to their special uses, viz.: 1. To disarm the opponents,
and to prevent their trumping your winning-cards;
and 2. To trump the winning cards of the adversaries.
In order to comprehend when trumps may be most
profitably applied to the first, and when to the second,
of these uses, we must first clearly perceive the objects
aimed at throughout the hand, viz.: to establish a suit,
to exhaust the adversaries' trumps, and to retain the
long trump, or a certain winning card with which to
get the lead again, for the purpose of bringing in the
suit; also to endeavour to obstruct similar designs of
the opponents. It follows that you should</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h4>13. LEAD TRUMPS WHEN VERY STRONG IN
THEM.</h4>


<p>It cannot be too strongly impressed that <em>the primary
use of strength in trumps is to draw the adversaries'
trumps for the bringing in of your own or your partner's
long suit</em>. With great strength in trumps (five or
more), you may proceed at once to disarm the opponents,
and lead trumps without waiting to establish
a suit. For, with five trumps or more, the chance of
your succeeding in drawing the other trumps, and
of being left with the long trumps is so considerable,
that you may then almost always lead trumps, whatever
your other cards. The exceptional hands are
principally those which contain five trumps without
an honour, and five small cards of a plain suit; or
five trumps without an honour, and four middling
cards of one plain suit together with four bad cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of another plain suit. But if the adversaries are at
the score of three, you should lead a trump with
these hands, as your partner must have two honours,
or very good cards out of trumps, for you to save the
game.</p>

<p>If you are at the score of three, the adversaries
being love, one, or two, you should not lead a trump
merely because you have five trumps with two honours,
if they are unaccompanied by a very strong suit,
or by good cards in each suit. For here, if your
partner has an honour, you probably win the
game in any case; and if he has no honour you open
the trump suit to a disadvantage. Some good players,
however, do not allow this to be an exceptional case.
The turn-up card may sometimes cause you to refrain
from leading trumps from five. Thus: you have king,
ten, nine, six, and four of spades (trumps); ace,
queen, and three small diamonds; and three small
hearts. You are four, and the ace of spades is
turned up. In the opinion of most players, the ace
of diamonds is the best original lead; but, if an ace
were not turned up, you should lead a trump.</p>

<p>It is often said, even by pretty good players,
"Strength in trumps is no reason for leading them,
unless you have a good suit as well." If both you
and your partner are devoid of good cards you cannot
make tricks; but should your partner hold one good
suit out of the three, you will very likely bring it in
for him by leading from strength in trumps. For,
even if you have a poor hand out of trumps, you will
discover in the course of play (<em>i.e.</em>, by the suits led or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
discarded by the other players), what your partner's
suit is, and will be able to lead it to him each time
you get the lead with your long trumps. Besides, if
your hand is weak out of trumps, you are placed in
the disadvantageous position of leading from a weak
suit unless you lead trumps.</p>

<p>You should not be deterred from leading trumps
because an honour is turned up to your right, nor
necessarily lead them because the same happens to
your left; either is proper if the circumstances of the
hand require it, but neither otherwise. To illustrate
this proposition, take this hand: ace, queen, and three
small spades (trumps), three small hearts, three small
clubs, and two small diamonds. The king of spades
is turned up fourth hand. The best lead is disputed;
but the author has no hesitation in advising the lead
of a small trump, notwithstanding that there is a
certain finesse over the king. A little consideration
will render this apparent. By leading the trump suit
originally, you obtain the advantages just enumerated,
and make the dealer open a suit up to your partner.
Your partner, as soon as he gets the lead, will return
the trump, and you thus obtain the command of
trumps whether the king was forced out in the first
round or not.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the severe consequences of leaving
the adversary with the long trump, you must be
cautious in leading trumps from less than five; four
trumps and a moderate hand not justifying an original
trump lead. You should, instead, lead your strong
plain suit, and if you establish it, and the adversaries do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
not meantime show any great strength, as by leading or
calling for trumps (pp. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>-127), you may then, with
four trumps, mostly venture a trump lead. With
strength in trumps you may generally finesse more
freely in the second and third rounds of trumps than
you would in plain suits. In plain suits an unsuccessful
finesse may result in the best card being
afterwards trumped, which cannot happen in trumps.
Moreover, by finessing, you keep the winning trump,
and so obtain the lead after the third round. This is
especially important when you have a suit established
and but four trumps. Here you should, generally, not
merely finesse in the second round, but hold up the
winning trump, and sometimes at this juncture refuse
to part with it even if the trump lead comes from the
adversary.</p>

<p>An example will render this more clear. The
leader (A) has ace, and three small trumps, a strong
suit, headed by ace, king, queen, and a probable trick,
say king and another, in a third suit. A should, in
the writer's judgment, lead a trump. If B (A's partner)
wins the first trick in trumps, and returns a strengthening
trump, A, as a rule, should not part with his ace.
When A or B obtain the lead again they play a third
round of trumps, which, being won by the ace, enables
A, by leading his tierce major, to get a force (<em>i.e.</em>, to
compel one of his adversaries to trump in order to win
the trick), in which case nothing short of five trumps
in one hand against him can prevent A's bringing in
his suit. You must be prepared for similar tactics on
the part of the adversaries, and not conclude that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
have not the best trump because they suffer you to
win the first or second round.</p>

<p>With a well protected hand containing four trumps,
two being honours, a trump may be led originally.
For here the chance of gaining by the trump lead may
be taken as greater than the chance of losing. Thus
with queen, knave, and two small trumps, a four suit
with an honour, say for example, knave, ten, nine, and
a small one, king guarded in the third suit, and queen
guarded in the fourth, a small trump if it finds partner
with an honour is by no means unlikely to win the
game. If partner turns out very weak in trumps the
leader must alter his plan, and, instead of continuing
the trump lead, play to make three, five or seven tricks
according to the fall of the cards in plain suits.</p>

<p>Trump leads, without strength in trumps, can only
be right in consequence of some special circumstance
in the state of the game, or of the score. For instance,
great commanding strength in all the plain suits may
call for a trump lead; or it may be necessitated to stop
a <em>cross-ruff</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, the alternate trumping by partners of
different suits, each leading the suit in which the other
renounces), in which case it is generally advisable to
take out two rounds if possible; so with the winning
trump you play it out, whatever your others are.
Again, if you have a wretched hand and you are love
to three or four, you assume that the game is lost,
unless your partner is very strong; and if he <em>is</em> very
strong, the trump is the best lead for him. This
doctrine is frequently carried to excess, as, by concealing
your weakness, you often stand a better chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of saving a point, if not the game, than by at once
exposing it. If, therefore, you have one four suit,
headed by an honour, you would generally do better
to choose that.</p>

<p>The trump lead is so much more important than
any other that you should almost always return your
partner's lead of trumps <em>immediately</em>, except he has led
from weakness, when you are not bound to return it
unless it suits your hand.</p>

<p>If you find one of the adversaries without a trump,
you should mostly proceed to establish your long suit,
and abstain from drawing two trumps for one; to say
nothing of the probability that the adversary who has
not renounced is unusually strong in trumps. Besides,
when he has the lead, he will very likely lead trumps
in order to draw two for one; and it is more advantageous
to you that the lead should come from him.
On the other hand, if your partner has no trump, it is
often right to endeavour to weaken the adversaries by
continuing even their trump lead.</p>

<p>It is a common artifice, if you wish a trump to be
led, to drop a high card to the adversary's lead, to
induce him to believe that you will trump it next
round, whereupon the leader will very likely change
the suit, and perhaps lead trumps. Thus, if he leads
king (from ace, king, and others), and you hold queen
and one other, it is evident that you cannot make the
queen. If you throw the queen to his king, he may
lead a trump to prevent your trumping his ace; but if
he goes on with the suit, and you drop your small
card, it may fairly be inferred that you have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
endeavouring to get him to lead a trump. Your partner
should now take the hint, and, if he gets the lead, lead
trumps; for if you want them led, it is of little consequence
from whom the lead comes. By a conventional
extension of this system to lower cards it is understood
that, whenever you throw away an <em>unnecessarily</em> high
card, it is a sign (after the smaller card drops) that you
want trumps led. This is called <em>asking for trumps</em> or
<em>calling for trumps</em>.</p>

<p>When you ask for trumps, you command your
partner to abandon his own game, and to lead a
trump; and you promise him, in return, if he has
reasonably good cards, either to win the game or to
make a considerable score. It has been laid down,
that the minimum strength in trumps which justifies
you in issuing such an order to your partner is four
trumps, two being honours, or five trumps, one being
an honour, accompanied by such cards in your own or
your partner's suits that you are reasonably secure of
not having a suit brought in against you. This rule,
however, only applies to an <em>original</em> ask. If you
have had the lead, and have not led a trump, or if you
have had an opportunity of asking and have not
asked, and you then ask for trumps at a later period
of the hand, the ask is not a command, like an original
one, nor does it necessarily imply the possession of the
minimum strength above stated. It merely means that,
from the fall of the cards, you consider a trump
lead would be very advantageous. For example: you
hold ace and a small spade; king, ten, and two small
hearts (trumps); queen and two small clubs; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
knave, ten and two other diamonds. You lead a small
diamond; your partner plays the queen; the fourth
hand plays the ace. A small club is now led through
you. You should ask for trumps.</p>

<p>When your partner asks for trumps, and you have
four or more at the time you obtain the lead, lead
the smallest, unless you have the ace, or three honours,
or queen, knave, ten; if you have only two or three
trumps when you obtain the lead, lead from the
highest downwards, whatever they are.</p>

<p>Before answering the ask, be sure that the higher
card, previously dropped, is <em>unnecessarily</em> high. For
instance a higher card is often played before a lower,
to show that you command the suit, or that you hold
the intermediate cards, or to get out of your partner's
way. It is very important to distinguish between
covering second hand and discarding an unnecessarily
high card. For example: with knave, ten, and one
other (say the three), it is usual to play the ten second
hand on a small card. When your three comes down
in the next round, it is not an ask for trumps, unless
your partner can infer that you do not hold the knave.
Moderate players, who know of the ask, never consider
this; so with them the choice of the least evil is
generally not to cover, for you otherwise run the
terrible risk of having a strengthening trump led to
you with a weak hand. To ask for trumps, second
hand, with knave, ten, and one other, you must play
the knave.</p>

<p>When your partner leads a trump, or asks for
trumps, if you have numerical strength in trumps, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
should ask at the first opportunity. This is called
the <em>echo of the call</em>, though it is made use of also in
response to a lead.</p>

<p>The advantages of the echo are manifold. Your
partner being strong in trumps may hesitate to take
a force, but your echo enables him to do so without
fear, and to persevere with the trump lead. Or, your
partner may be in doubt after the second round of
trumps as to the policy of playing a third. But if
he can count two more trumps in your hand he will
be directed. Thus: eight are out, your partner has
three more; you have echoed. He will know that the
other two are in your hand, and will not draw two for
none, as without the echo, he might do.</p>

<p>The negative advantage of the echo should not be
overlooked. Thus: to take the same case of eight
trumps being out, and the leader with three more
trumps. You (his partner) have had the chance of
sounding an echo, but have not done so. The leader
knows that you have not both the remaining trumps,
and he will regulate his game accordingly.</p>

<p>To your partner's trump lead you echo in the trump
suit; the same if partner calls, and you are forced.
Thus: you have eight, seven, five, two of trumps;
your left-hand adversary leads king, ace of a suit of
which you only hold one. Your partner calls. You
echo, by trumping with the five, and you then lead
the eight. On the second round of trumps, when
your deuce falls, the echo is completed. Your partner
knows that you have one more trump, either the six
or the seven. If you had not echoed, he might not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
able to tell for certain whether you hold another trump
or not. (<em>See</em> Hands XXXIV., XXXV.)</p>

<p>If you have four trumps and are forced, and your
partner then leads or asks for trumps, you should
echo, notwithstanding that you no longer have
numerical strength. This case can best be illustrated
by an example. (<em>See</em> Hand XXXVI.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The use of strength in trumps being to disarm the
opponents, it follows that you should as much as possible
husband your strength for that purpose. Therefore

<h4>14. DO NOT TRUMP A DOUBTFUL CARD IF
STRONG IN TRUMPS.</h4>


<p>By a doubtful card is meant a card of a suit of
which your partner <em>may</em> have the best.</p>

<p>Whether you should trump or refuse to trump a
doubtful card depends almost entirely on your strength
in trumps. It has already been mentioned that it is
an advantage to trump when you are weak, for you
thus make a little trump, which is not available for
the other uses of trumps, and which, if not used for
trumping, will presently be drawn by the strong hand.
It is conversely a disadvantage to trump a doubtful
card when you are strong in trumps, for by trumping
you weaken your numerical power, and diminish the
probability of your bringing in a suit. If, instead of
trumping, you throw away a losing card, you inform
your partner that you have strength in trumps, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
also, by your discard, what your strong suit is; and
if your partner has any strength in the suit led, you
leave him in a favourable position.</p>

<p>If you refuse to overtrump, or to trump a certain
winning card, your partner should conclude either that
you have no trump, or more probably four trumps and
a powerful hand besides. If he concludes that you
are reserving your trumps to bring in a suit, he should
assist you by leading trumps as soon as he can. A
refusal to be thus forced is seldom requisite if you
have more than four trumps; with six you are mostly
strong enough to trump and to lead trumps; with
five you may do the same, if your suit is established;
but if not, it is generally best to take the force, and to
lead your suit.</p>

<p>The situations in which it is most necessary to
refuse to overtrump your right-hand adversary, or to
refuse to trump a winning card, occur when you have
four trumps and a very strong suit, or a suit established
early in a hand. For then, by trumping, you
prejudice your chance of bringing in the suit in order
to secure one trick. By refusing to part with a
trump in these cases, you obtain the advantages just
enumerated, at the time when they are most likely to
become of service; and, where you refuse to overtrump,
your adversary is left with one trump less, by
which your hand is strengthened.</p>

<p>Many players run into the extreme of always refusing
to be forced by a winning card when they are strong
in trumps. The situations, however, just indicated,
are almost the only ones in which it answers to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
up; and these even are liable to several exceptions.
For instance:&mdash;1. You should not persist in refusing
to be forced if you find that the adversary has the
entire command of his suit. 2. You should not refuse
if your partner evidently intends to force you; and,
3. You should not refuse to overtrump if you have
reason to believe that your left-hand adversary is
strong in trumps.</p>

<p>With an untaught partner it is useless to refuse to
trump; he will not understand it, but will continue
to force you. With such, the best course is rather to
make tricks when you can than to play for a great
game.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From what has just been said, it is evidently an
advantage to</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h4>15. FORCE A STRONG TRUMP HAND OF THE
ADVERSARY.</h4>


<p>For you thereby take the best chance of preventing
his making use of his trumps for bringing in a suit.
If he refuses to take a force, keep on giving it to him.</p>

<p>For instance, if he passes your king (led from king,
queen, &amp;c.), and the king wins, continue the suit, and
so on. Some players can never be brought to understand
this; they do not like to see their winning cards
trumped, and therefore frequently change their suit or
even lead trumps when an adversary refuses to be
forced.</p>

<p>It now hardly requires to be stated that it is bad
play intentionally to force a weak adversary, and still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
worse to lead a suit to which both adversaries renounce,
as the weak will trump and the strong get rid
of a losing card.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If you have numerical strength in trumps, you are
justified in forcing your partner, relying on your own
strength to disarm the opponents. But</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<hr class="chap" />




<h4>16. DO NOT FORCE YOUR PARTNER IF YOU ARE
WEAK IN TRUMPS.</h4>


<p>For you thus weaken him, and leave it in the
power of the antagonists to draw all the trumps, and
bring in their suit. If, then, a good partner refrains
from forcing you, you may be sure he is weak; on the
other hand, if he evidently <em>intends</em> to force you (as by
leading a losing card of a suit he knows you must
trump), you may assume that he is strong in trumps,
and you should take the force willingly, even though
you do not want to be forced, depending on his strength
to exhaust the adversaries' trumps.</p>

<p>You may, however, though weak, force your partner
under these circumstances. 1. When he has already
shown a desire to be forced, or weakness in trumps,
as by trumping a doubtful card, or by refraining from
forcing you. 2. When you have a cross-ruff, which
secures several tricks at once, and is therefore often
more advantageous than trying to establish a suit.
3. Sometimes when you are playing a close game,
as for the odd trick, and often when one trick saves
or wins the game or a point. And 4. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
when great strength in trumps has been declared
against you.</p>

<p>If your partner leads a thirteenth card, or a card
of a suit in which he knows that both you and the
fourth player renounce, your play must depend on
your partner's strength in trumps. If he is strong,
he wants you to put on your best trump, either to
make the trumps separately, or to force out one or
two high ones, to leave himself with the command.
If he is weak in trumps, he wants you to pass the
card, that the fourth player may obtain the lead, and
lead up to your hand. No general rule can be given
as to the course to be pursued with regard to thirteenth
cards. You must judge of the leader's intention by
the score and the previous fall of the cards.</p>

<h4>17. PLAY TO THE SCORE;<br />

AND<br />

18. WATCH THE FALL OF THE CARDS, AND DRAW
YOUR INFERENCES AT THE TIME.</h4>


<p>These two all-important principles have already been
mentioned as causing differences in the play. The
commonest form in which the former is presented to us
is this: at the score of Love-all five tricks save the
game against two by honours. It is often right, therefore,
when two by honours have been declared against
you, to go for the fifth trick by leading off a winning
card, or by putting one on second or third hand.</p>

<p>To explain further what is meant by playing to the
score, put yourself in this situation. Four trumps
remain in, the adversaries have two winning trumps,
it being uncertain whether they are in one hand or
divided; you have the two losing trumps, two forcing
cards, and the lead; you can only play correctly by
referring to the score. Thus, if the adversary is at
four, and you have won five, or even six tricks, your
game would be to secure two tricks by forcing; for if
you play a trump and the two against you are in the
same hand, you lose the game. But suppose you are
at the point of two, and the adversaries are not at
four, and you have won six tricks, your game would
be to risk the trump; for if you bring down the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
trumps you win the game; but by playing to force
you make certain of scoring only four. By applying
this mode of reasoning you will often be directed as
to a finesse late in a hand. (Further illustrations of
playing to the score occur in the hands.)</p>

<p>For simple examples of drawing inferences at the
time of the fall of the cards take the following:&mdash;1.
You lead a small card from ace, knave, &amp;c.; your
partner wins with the queen; you should <em>immediately</em>
(<em>i.e.</em>, before another card is led) infer that the king
cannot be with your right-hand adversary. Hence, on
the return of the suit, you would not finesse the knave.
2. You are second player, and a suit is led in which
you have king, ten, and one small one. You play the
small one. The third hand plays the queen, which is
won with the ace. You should <em>at once</em> infer that the
third hand cannot have the knave, and that you may
safely finesse the ten next round.</p>

<p>You will greatly assist your memory by systematically
recording inferences in the above manner. In
addition to this you should apply your knowledge of
the principles to noting important points, not attempting
too much at first. Begin by counting the trumps
as they fall, and notice, at all events, the honours, and
remember the turn-up card. By degrees you will find
yourself able to recollect the ten and nine, and then
the smaller trumps. Next attend to the suit led
originally by each player, and watch in the second
round whether the lead was from strength or weakness.
Try also to remember the fall of the cards in
your own strong suit, that you may know when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
is established. Beyond this, experience will enable
you to judge what to retain and what to reject in each
hand; so that, with practice, you will acquire what
may be termed <em>whist memory</em> which will enable you,
without any great effort, to recollect the principal
features of every hand.</p>

<p>The fall of the cards may, one time or another,
modify nearly every rule of play. A player who
simply follows rule, and fails to grasp the situations
in which rule should be departed from, is a mere
machine without intelligence. General principles only
apply to the general case; to apply them to particular
cases, observation, inference, and judgment are essential.
Thus, in the Analysis of Leads, it appears that
the card which should be led in trumps often differs
from the card which should be led in plain suits.
The reason is given at p. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>. But it will be clear
to any one who reads between the lines, that plain
suits should be led like trumps, if all the remaining
trumps are in the leader's or his partner's hands; or,
if all the trumps are out, and the leader or his partner
has certain cards of re-entry in other suits.</p>

<p>As another example, take the case of returned leads.
A leads a small card; the second hand plays a small
card; B (third hand) puts on the eight; the fourth
hand wins with the queen. When B gets the lead he
returns the knave. It is evident that B must have
the ten and the nine. Here two principles appear to
conflict. One rule is, with four originally return the
smallest; the other rule is convey information to your
partner. When a player has thus to choose between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
two rules, he must use his intelligence, in order to
decide under which rule his greater advantage lies.
In the example given, the return of the knave cannot
deceive partner as to the number of cards held in the
suit; if he takes the trouble to think, he will at once
perceive that the rule as to returned leads has been
departed from, in order to convey information.</p>

appear by placing the unknown cards in any other
way. A therefore plays on the assumption that Y
holds a spade and a diamond in addition to the trump
which is declared in his hand.</p>

to place the lead <em>see</em> Hand XXXV.</p>


<h5>CASE III.</h5>

<p>It is the duty of a player to make the game as
easy to his partner as he can. The play often depends
on the sort of partner. For example:&mdash;you
lead the ten from king, queen, knave, ten, only, or
from king, knave, ten, &amp;c. Suppose the lead to
be from the former combination, and that your ten
forces the ace from the fourth hand. You obtain
the lead again. The proper lead now is the queen.
(<em>See</em> Analysis of Leads, p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>). But, with an indifferent
partner, the better lead is the king, as he
may not have drawn the correct inference from the
first lead, and knowing the queen is not the best, he
may trump it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>However good your partner may be, you should not
put him into unnecessary difficulties. For example:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Play and Remarks.</span>&mdash;A leads the seven of
hearts. Y should put on the king, though certain of
being able to win with the nine. For, if Y wins with
the nine, he compels Z to play a coup, viz., to trump
the best heart, in order to get the lead through the
queen, ten of spades; but, if Y wins with the king and
leads the losing heart, it requires no ingenuity on Z's
part to trump it.</p>

<h4>COUPS.</h4>


<p>There is no Whist principle which should not be
occasionally violated, owing to the knowledge of the
hands derived from inference during the play. Some
of the more frequent of the cases, <em>where a general
rule can be given for departing from rule</em>, may
advantageously close this Section.</p>


<h5>LEADING FROM WEAKEST SUIT.</h5>

<p>It is advisable in most cases where the game is
desperate, and where it is clear that your partner
must be strong in your weak suit to save the game,
to lead your weakest suit, notwithstanding Principle 1
(p. <a href="#Page_56">56</a>). Your partner should finesse deeply in the
suit you lead him, and should not return it, but,
actuated by motives similar to yours, should lead his
weakest suit, in which you should finesse deeply, and
continue your weak suit, and so on.</p>

<p>For example: AB (partners) lead trumps. They
win the first three tricks, and show four by honours,
and three more trumps remain in A's hand. Consequently,
if AB win another trick, they win the game.
Y or Z now has the lead for the first time. <em>His lead
should be from his weakest suit</em>, on this principle: if
his partner has not the command of it, or a successful
finesse in it, the game is lost. Say Y leads, and Z
wins the trick. Z should not return Y's lead, but
should similarly lead his weakest suit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For an illustration of this coup, <em>see</em> Hand XXVII.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>


<h5>TREATING LONG SUITS LIKE SHORT ONES,
AND VICE VERSÂ.</h5>

<p>It often happens towards the end of a hand, that an
unplayed suit, of which the leader holds (say) four
cards, can only go round twice, <em>e.g.</em>, there may be two
trumps left in in one of the opponents' hands. In
such a case, if your suit is headed by queen or knave,
you should treat it as a suit of two cards only, and
lead your highest, as this gives the best chance of
making two tricks in the suit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the reverse case, where a suit can only go
round once, it is obvious that a small card should
be led, so as not to tempt partner to finesse. Thus,
holding queen and one small card of an unplayed
suit, which you are about to lead, all the opponents'
cards but one being winning cards, the proper lead is
the small card.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For an illustration <em>see</em> Hand XXII.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is another case, known as <em>Deschapelles' coup</em>,
where the proper card to lead is not determined by
the leader's numerical power in the suit. It is this:
all the adversaries' and partner's trumps are exhausted,
and the leader's partner remains with an established
suit. If the leader (not having any of his partner's
suit left) is obliged to open a fresh suit headed by
king, queen, or knave, he should lead the highest
card, irrespective of the number of cards he holds in
the suit, that being the best chance of subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
procuring the lead for his partner in case his only card
of entry in that suit should be an honour, not the ace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For an illustration of this coup, <em>see</em> Hand XXVIII.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Deschapelles' coup often succeeds in practice, but
it may generally be defeated by an attentive player.
When the above-described position of the cards
occurs, the adversary, if he has the ace of the fresh
suit led, should not put it on first round. The suit
will, in all probability, be continued with a low card,
when the third player will most likely be compelled
to play his highest, which will be taken by the ace;
and, having lost the card of re-entry, he never brings
in his suit, unless he gets the lead in some other way.</p>


<h5>REFUSING TO WIN THE SECOND ROUND
OF A SUIT.</h5>

<p>This is a case of by no means infrequent occurrence.
For example: one of the adversaries has a
long suit declared in his favour, which is led a
second time. Only one trump remains in, which
is in the hand of the second or fourth player. As
a rule, the second round of the suit should not be
trumped. The third round will probably exhaust
the adverse hand, which is numerically weak in the
suit. If it so happens that the player who is
numerically strong in it has no card of re-entry in
any other suit, he will then never bring in his long
suit, as his partner, whose hand is exhausted, cannot
lead it again, should he get the lead after the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
round. If there is a card of re-entry in the hand of
the player who has numerical strength, he must bring
in the suit, whether the second round is trumped
or not.</p>

<p><em>See</em> Hand XXIX for an illustration of this position.</p>

<p>A similar rule applies, but less frequently, when
one adversary has the long trumps, and his partner
a long suit nearly established.</p>

<p>For an illustration of this position, <em>see</em> Hand XXX.</p>


<h5>DECLINING TO DRAW THE LOSING TRUMP.</h5>

<p>When all the trumps are out but two, and the
leader remains with the best trump, the losing trump
being in the hand of his adversary, the natural and
obvious play is to draw the last trump.</p>

<p>But there is a class of cases in which the trump
should not be drawn as a matter of course, viz., if one
adversary has a long suit established, and his partner
has a card of that suit to lead.</p>

<p>The case usually happens in this way: YZ (partners)
lead a suit, and after two rounds establish it. They
then lead trumps from a suit of four trumps (<em>see</em> p.
<a href="#Page_123">123</a>). Eleven trumps come out, and A (YZ's adversary)
has the lead and the best trump, one of the
opponents having the losing trump. The question
then arises, Should A draw the trump?</p>

<p>A should draw the trump if he has also an established
suit; or, if B (A's partner) has an established
suit, and A can put the lead into B's hand. For, in
these two cases, A or B cannot do better than bring in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
their suit. Again, A should draw the trump, if the
adversary who has a suit established (say Z) has also
the losing trump, for then, if either Y or Z has a card
of re-entry in either of the other two suits, Z cannot
be prevented from bringing in his established suit.
Lastly, A should draw the trump if Y (Z's partner) has
the losing trump, and Z has, declared in his hand, two
cards of re-entry. The last case may be dismissed as
of but little practical use, as, at the time when A has
to decide whether he will draw the trump, he will
seldom know enough about the remaining cards to be
positive that Z has two cards of re-entry.</p>

<p>In the above cases, A, by not drawing the trump,
makes his adversaries a present of a trick.</p>

<p>On the other hand, A should not draw the trump if
one opponent (Z) has an established suit, which Y (Z's
partner) can lead, the losing trump being in Y's hand.
And, it is especially incumbent on A not to draw the
trump, if either he or his partner has a suit which will
probably be established by leading it, and if A can
infer from the fall of the cards that Y has <em>only one card</em>
of his partner's established suit in his hand, subject, of
course, to the qualifications already noted.</p>

<p>The point aimed at in not drawing the trump, is,
first to get the commanding card of A's or B's long
suit out of the adverse hand. Y or Z thus obtains the
lead, and continues the established suit, which A
trumps with the winning trump. If, now, Z has no
card of re-entry in the fourth&mdash;or unopened&mdash;suit, he
never brings in his established suit, Y not having
another card of it to lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>The case is difficult to carry when stated thus
generally; for an illustration, <em>see</em> Hand XXXI.</p>


<h5>REFUSING TO OVERTRUMP.</h5>

<p>Cases often happen where it is not advisable to
overtrump. Most of these depend on the fall of the
cards and on inferences from the play (<em>see</em> Hands
XXIII, XXIV), and cannot be generalised. But there
is one case in which it is <em>never right</em> to overtrump, viz.,
when three cards remain in each hand, and one player
holds the second and third best trumps, with one of
which he trumps the card led. If the player to his
left has the best and fourth best trumps, he can never
gain anything by overtrumping, and may lose a trick,
as the following example shows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image0146_a.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">


<div class="center">
<ul><li>Y <span class="red">9♦</span>, <span class="red">4♦</span>, <span class="red">10♥</span></li>
<li>B 9♠, 8♠, Knv♣</li>
<li>Z Kg♠, 6♠, <span class="red">A♦</span></li>
<li>A 3♠, <span class="red">8♥</span>, <span class="red">7♥</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>The position of the trumps (spades) is known. A
leads a heart, B trumps it. If Z overtrumps he loses
the other two tricks, but if he throws the ace of
diamonds he wins the other two tricks.</p>

<p>This rule for not overtrumping cannot be laid down
absolutely when there are more than three cards in
hand; but when only four trumps remain in, second
and third best against best and fourth, it is so frequently
advisable not to overtrump, that the player
should consider well the position of the remaining
cards before overtrumping.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For an illustration of this case, <em>see</em> Hand XXV.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since it is so often right not to overtrump under these
circumstances, it follows that when the case arises the
player who holds second and third best should, as a
rule, attempt to defeat the coup by playing a false
card&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, he should trump with the higher card in
hopes of deceiving his left hand opponent as to the
position of the third best trump.</p>


<h5>THROWING HIGH CARDS TO PLACE THE
LEAD.</h5>

<p>This coup presents itself in a variety of forms; the
following are selected as likely to be of use.</p>

<p>Whenever you are left at the end of a hand with the
tenace in trumps (either best and third best, or second
best guarded) over the player to your right, and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
other cards, both being cards of the suit led by him,
you, second hand, should <em>always</em> throw the highest
card of his lead to that trick. You can never lose
by so doing, and may win. For example: you have
nine and five of the suit led. Throw the nine. For,
in the second round of the suit, it may so happen that
you get the lead with the nine. If the cards lie thus,
for instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image0148_a.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">


<div class="center">
<ul><li>Y 9♣, 5♣, <span class="red">A♥</span>, <span class="red">10♥</span></li>
<li>B Knv♣, <span class="red">Qn♦</span>, <span class="red">8♦</span>, <span class="red">6♦</span></li>
<li>Z Kg♣, Qn♣, 8♣, 3♣</li>
<li>A A♣, 6♣, <span class="red">Kg♥</span>, <span class="red">7♥</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Y has the tenace in hearts (trumps) over A. A
leads ace of clubs. If Y does not throw the nine, and
Z plays carelessly and fails to win Y's nine in the next
round, YZ lose a trick. Of course, Z ought to win
the second round, but it is Y's duty to render it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
impossible for Z not to do so (<em>see</em> Remarks on making
it easy to Partner, p. <a href="#Page_139">139</a>).</p>

<p>The typical example of this coup is the case where
the leader plays the ace, and the second player has
king guarded, as in the following example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image0149_a.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">


<div class="center">
<ul><li>Y A♠, Knv♠, <span class="red">Kg♦</span>, <span class="red">2♦</span></li>
<li>B</li>
<li>Z</li>
<li>A Kg♠, 10♠, <span class="red">A♦</span>, <span class="red">4♦</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Spades trumps. There are only four spades in, and
Y knows that A has the king, ten. B's and Z's cards
are immaterial.</p>

<p>A leads the ace of diamonds. If Y plays the two
of diamonds he can only make two tricks; but, if he
throws the king to the ace, he still makes two tricks,
and, if his partner has the queen of diamonds, he
makes three tricks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This coup may be similarly played in plain suits.
For an illustration <em>see</em> Hand XXXII.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>The following fine coup (which occurred in actual
play) exemplifies a similar, but more complicated,
case:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image0150_a.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">

<ul><li>Y Kg♣, 5♣, 3♣, 2♣</li>
<li>B 9♣, 6♣, <span class="red">10♥</span>, <span class="red">8♥</span></li>
<li>Z A♣, Qn♣, <span class="red">Qn♥</span>, <span class="red">9♥</span></li>
<li>A Knv♣, 10♣, 8♣, 7♣</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Score: YZ require every trick. Hearts trumps.
It is known that the trumps lie between B and Z.</p>

<p>A leads a club; Y and B play small clubs. Z,
knowing that B holds the second best trump guarded,
takes the only chance of saving the game, by winning
the first trick in clubs with the ace, and returning
the queen. Y, seeing his partner's anxiety to get
rid of the lead, rightly conjectures him to hold the
major tenace in trumps. He, therefore, wins his
partner's queen of clubs with the king, and saves
the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>It being known that the remaining trumps lie between
B and Z, Y would be right to win the second round
of clubs under all circumstances of the score.</p>

<p>For another illustration of this coup, <em>see</em> Hand
XXXIII.</p>

<p>On a similar principle, the leader not infrequently
leads a losing plain card, or a losing trump, at the end
of a hand, in order to place the lead. For illustrations,
<em>see</em> Case II, p. <a href="#Page_138">138</a>, and Hands XVI, XVII,
and XXXV.</p>


<h5>THE GRAND COUP.</h5>

<p>The <em>Grand Coup</em> consists in throwing away a superfluous
trump. At the first glance it appears impossible
to have a superabundance of trumps; but cases sometimes
happen where a player has <em>a trump too many</em>.
To get rid of this trump&mdash;as by undertrumping a
trick already trumped by your partner, or by trumping
a trick which he has won, or which you know he may
win&mdash;is to play the <em>grand coup</em>.</p>

<p>The opportunity for playing the <em>grand coup</em> generally
happens in this way. Two rounds of trumps come
out, leaving five trumps in, two in the hand of (say)
B, and three in the hand of Z (the player to his left).
If B has the best and third best trumps, or the second
best guarded, and trumps are not led again, nor used
for trumping, it is clear that at the eleventh trick Z
must obtain the lead, and must lead up to the tenace
in trumps. If, before the eleventh trick, Z trumps a
trick of his partner's (or, in the case of only seven
trumps coming out in two rounds, undertrumps a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
trick already trumped by his partner), and the lead at
the eleventh trick can thus be kept in&mdash;or put into&mdash;Z's
partner's hand, the <em>grand coup</em> comes off, as in the
following example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image0152_a.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">


<div class="center">
<ul><li>Y Qn♠, <span class="red">5♥</span>, <span class="red">3♥</span>, 6♣</li>
<li>B 10♣, 7♣, <span class="red">5♦</span>, <span class="red">3♦</span></li>
<li>Z <span class="red">Knv♥</span>, Knv♣, 9♣, 5♣</li>
<li>A 8♠, 6♠, <span class="red">10♦</span>, <span class="red">9♦</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Clubs trumps. Z knows that B has ten and
another trump. A leads the ten of diamonds; Y
trumps with the six of clubs; Z undertrumps with
the five. If he retains his three trumps, and B refuses
to trump the queen of spades next led by Y, Z loses a
trick in clubs.</p>

<p>The opportunity for playing the <em>grand coup</em> is often
missed. A player should always be on the look-out
for it when he has five trumps, especially if a trump is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
led to his right. It should be added also, that if
the player who attempts it retains a high card in
his hand, he may be just as badly off as though he
remained with three trumps. Thus, holding three
trumps against two, and ace and another card of
another suit, it is not sufficient that he disposes of
one of his trumps; he should also get rid of his
ace (<em>see</em> Remarks on Throwing High Cards to place
the Lead, pp. <a href="#Page_147">147</a>-151). The following example will
render this more clear:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image0153_a.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">


<div class="center">

<li>Z <span class="red">Qn♦</span>, <span class="red">10♦</span>, <span class="red">9♦</span>, <span class="red">8♦</span></li>

</ul>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Hearts trumps. B has already got rid of his superfluous
trump. A leads the eight of clubs. B should
throw the ace of diamonds to it. For, if B has the
lead after the next trick, he might just as well have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
kept his third trump. If A has the king of diamonds,
B wins a trick by discarding the ace; and, if A has
not the king, B loses nothing by throwing the ace.</p>

<p>An exception to this rule is when A has winning
cards to go on with. Thus, if A had another club, B
need not discard the ace of diamonds. This is too
obvious to require working out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is another aspect under which the
<em>grand coup</em> may present itself:&mdash;</p>

</ul>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Hearts trumps. It is known that B has king,
queen, knave of trumps, and a losing spade or club&mdash;but
uncertain which.</p>

<p>A leads the knave of diamonds. B trumps it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Z should throw away a small trump, undertrumping B
in order to keep two winning queens. If he discards
a queen, he must do so at random, and perhaps throw
away the suit of which B has the small one. By discarding
his useless trump (which B would proceed to
draw) he defers parting with either queen till after the
next round, when the fall of the cards may assist him.
B now leads a trump, and Y discards the losing club.
B then leads another trump, and Z now knows that he
ought to keep the spade. This case actually occurred
in the presence of the writer, but Z, instead of undertrumping,
discarded the wrong queen at random, and
eventually lost the rubber in consequence.</p>

<p>If the foregoing principles are reflectively perused, it
will be seen that they mould the Theory of Whist into
a harmonious whole. The Theory of Whist tells you
how to play your own hand to the greatest advantage,
how to assist your partner, and how to weaken and to
obstruct your opponents; in short, it teaches how to
take the best chance of making the greatest number
of tricks. This knowledge constitutes a <em>sound</em> player.
If to theoretical perfection you add the power of accurate
observation, and of acute perception, together with
a thorough comprehension of the whist capacities of
partners and of opponents, you have all the elements
necessary to form a Master of the Science.</p>

<h2>PART II.<br />

HANDS.</h2>


<p>The following hands are given in illustration of the
general principles discussed in Part I. The plan
adopted in the arrangement of the hands is to imitate
closely the circumstances of actual play. Thus, at
starting, one player's hand is known, together with
the score and the turn-up card. Each player is then
caused to play a card in his turn, and at the end of
the trick, the one player whose hand is known makes
observations, and draws inferences from the play, as
though he were at the whist table.</p>

<p>A, Y, B, and Z, are the four players throughout.
They are placed at the table in the above order, A and
B being partners against Y and Z. A is the first
leader, and Z the dealer. In "the play" the cards of
each trick are placed in the order in which the players
sit round the table, the card played by the person
whose hand is under consideration being the one
nearest to the reader. The capital letter by each card
shows to which player it belongs.</p>

<p>All the players are supposed to follow the ordinary
rules of play, as laid down in Part I. Thus, each
player is credited with leading originally from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
strongest suit, and with leading the card of it indicated
in the Analysis of Leads (pp. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>-71); with
playing the lowest of a sequence when not leading;
with returning the highest of a numerically weak
suit, the lowest of a strong suit, and so on.</p>

<p>It has been remarked by critics, that the players
are often made to play badly. Most of the hands
are taken from actual play; but, independently of
this, illustrations of indifferent play, with comments,
are obviously of value, as showing the kind of errors
that are likely to be made, and how and why to avoid
them.</p>

trump lead. A, at
the first start, with but four
trumps, and only one heart,
would not have been justified
in leading a trump.
But, his strong suit being
established, and his partner
having (probably) the best
heart, his game is now to lead trumps. Consider carefully
the Management of Trumps (pp. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>-23), and apply the
arguments there made use of to the present situation.</p>

<p>At Trick 10, if A plays ace of clubs he will be left with
a losing club. By passing, he gives B a chance of winning
the trick, and cannot lose even if Y has king of clubs. It
has been suggested that Z's best lead, at Trick 10, is king
of clubs, on the chance of catching ace and knave; but
Z's play is not under examination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 6).&mdash;A has now the command of his
suit, and four trumps. The adversaries have not shown
any particular strength in trumps, either by leading them
or by calling for them, though they have had the opportunity
of doing both, and A therefore assumes that the
trumps are pretty evenly divided, and leads a trump (<em>see</em>
pp. <a href="#Page_122">122</a>, <a href="#Page_123">123</a>). A is not deterred from opening the trump
suit because an honour was turned up (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_122">122</a>).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>B's winning the trick with the queen shows that Z has

</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 7).&mdash;B returns his partner's lead of
trumps (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is the important trick of the hand. Note the card
returned by B, the seven, and if in doubt as to the fall of
the trumps, look at the previous trick (<em>see</em> Law 91, p. <a href="#Page_18">18</a>).
In that trick, the small clubs that fall are the three, six,
and four, and in the present one, the seven, five, and ten.
Nobody having played the two, A may place it by inference
in B's hand, for the adversaries not winning the trick may
be supposed to play their lowest cards. Assuming B to
hold the two, it may be inferred that he has that card and
no other left in the suit. For he returns the seven, a
higher card than the two; and the rule is to return the
higher of two remaining cards, the lowest if holding more
than two (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>. Consider carefully the example given
there, and apply it to the present situation).</p>

<p>The king and knave are therefore in the opponents'
hands, and divided. Z has the knave (which he turned
up), and he has not the king, as he could not win the
queen in the previous trick. Y must consequently hold it.</p>

<p>It may be objected that this train of reasoning is too
close and elaborate to serve the purpose of inexperienced
players. It is, perhaps, a little difficult for an elementary
hand; but the careful observance of the rule of play
respecting returned leads is so important, that it has been
deemed advisable to insist strongly upon it. Of course,
when playing with those who do not attend to the conversation
of the game, all pains bestowed on working out
the position of the cards from such data as the preceding
is so much trouble thrown away.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that A's partner can be depended on
to play according to rule, it is morally certain that the
trumps are evenly divided, and that a third round will
leave A with a long trump to bring in his spades.
Accordingly, A leads the eight of clubs (<em>see</em> Trick 8,
above).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 12).&mdash;A's lead here is instructive. He
knows his partner (B) has one diamond and no spade and
no heart (<em>see</em> Tricks 5, 7, and 10). B's other card must therefore
be a club (trump). If it is the best trump, A wins two
by cards by leading a trump. But if it is not the winning
trump, a trump lead loses the odd trick. It is better to
make certain of the odd trick than to risk losing it for the
chance of winning two by cards; for the odd trick makes
a difference of two to the score. A therefore properly
ensures the odd trick by forcing his partner (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_134">134</a>).</p>

<p>Suppose the score to be AB three, and YZ one. Then
A would be justified in leading the trump at Trick 12.
For, if B has the ten, AB win two by cards and the game;
and, if B has not the ten, AB lose the odd trick; the score
remaining AB three, YZ two. It is better to run the risk
of this score for the sake of the game, than to make certain
of scoring only four and of leaving the adversaries at one.</p>

<p class="center">AB win the odd trick.

of the return of the

2, in accordance with General
Principle 5 (p. <a href="#Page_79">79</a>). The
command is left with the
presumably strong hand;
and the queen is completely
hemmed in. It is true the
queen might have been in
Y's hand. In that case the
queen must make whatever
card is returned. A similar
position occurs at Trick 9.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark.</span>&mdash;A did not lead
the trump at first; but now
he does so for these reasons:
he has the long card of his
suit; trumps are his strongest
suit (p. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>); and the
adversaries have had the
opportunity of calling for
trumps (<em>see</em> pp. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>, <a href="#Page_126">126</a>),
and have not made use of
it, which is negative evidence
that there is no very
great strength of trumps in
one hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 6).&mdash;The lead here is the point in the
hand. Y has three tricks up; there is a whole suit (clubs)
against him, and his adversary B has called for trumps (<em>see</em>
Tricks 3 and 4). It is, consequently, Y's duty to make five
tricks (which save the game if Z has an honour) as quickly
as possible. He therefore leads the ace of spades to make
the fourth trick, and (Trick 7) forces his partner (though
without any strength of trumps in his own hand, <em>see</em>
pp. <a href="#Page_132">132</a>, <a href="#Page_133">133</a>) to make the fifth.</p>

<p>At Trick 2, B, with the club suit well nigh established
(assuming his partner to have led from strength), and four
trumps, two honours, should risk a trump lead. He cannot
lose the game; and if his partner has an average hand, a
trump lead will, in all probability, give AB a good score.
As a matter of fact it would win the game, but that proves

more hearts (<em>see</em> Remark,
Trick 9) and one other card,
either the deuce of diamonds
(<em>see</em> the fall of the diamonds,
Tricks 4 and 5), or a trump.
If Y has the diamond, it
matters not what Z leads, as B must then hold four
trumps. Z therefore assumes that his partner has another
trump, and plays to force him.</p>

<p>But if Z could not tell that Y has three hearts, or rather
could tell that he has only two, Z's proper lead at
Trick 10 would be the ace of hearts. For then B must
have a heart, and if Z leads a losing diamond, B discards
his heart on it, and wins the game.</p>

<p>At Trick 3, Y plays badly to trump the doubtful spade
(<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_129">129</a>). At same trick, B plays well to get rid of the
command of his partner's suit (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>), as A, from the
lead, must have knave of spades, and Z, from the previous
fall of the cards, must have the ten single.</p>

<p>At Trick 4, Y's continuing the trump is bad, after ruining
his numerical strength. For he has no particular strength
out of trumps (<em>see</em> his hand), and his partner is evidently
very weak in trumps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>As the cards happen to lie, if Z does not put on ace of
diamonds second hand at Trick 9, A brings in the spades,
and YZ lose the game instead of winning it.</p>

only winning hearts and a losing club; and this being so,

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 9).&mdash;The lead of ace, followed by knave,
indicates a five card suit, headed by ace, queen, knave, and
a desire that partner, if he holds the king, should put it on
second round (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_101">101</a>). But in this case Y can count the
hands, and therefore departs from rule, and does not put
on the king. Z has a trump, and three diamonds, the ten
guarded being in B's hand. If Y follows rule and puts on
king of diamonds, he loses a trick in diamonds; by passing
the knave, he ensures five by cards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tricks</span> 9 to 13.&mdash;Y (Trick 9) leads a spade. He is
directed to the spade suit by Z's <em>original discard</em> of a
club at Trick 6 (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>), notwithstanding that Z has
since discarded two spades. Z plays properly to keep his
queen of clubs guarded after his first discard, as he only
wants at most two tricks besides the two trumps which he
knows to be in Y's hand. Y, at Trick 8, leads a heart to
show he has all the other hearts, as it is possible that the
best heart may be held up by the adversary. Y thus tells
Z not to finesse if he has one trick certain (<em>see</em> score).</p>

<p>Z puts on the ace of spades, at Trick 9, as that card and
the two trumps in Y's hand make the game. If Z finesses
he only scores four, as will be seen by referring to the
hands below. Z's play would not be right if he had only
five tricks up, as he would then want one more trick to win
the game. In that case he should finesse. This is a good
illustration of playing to the score.</p>

<p class="center">YZ score three by cards and two by honours.

trumps has been adversely declared by the call (<em>see</em>

not the queen of diamonds.</p>

<p>At Trick 2, Z plays the turn-up card (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_114">114</a>).</p>

<p>At Trick 3, B passes the nine of trumps. If the tenace
is against him covering does no good; and there is a
reasonable chance that the ace will fall.</p>

<p>At Trick 6, B, having found A weak in trumps, and the
whole diamond suit being declared against him, alters his
tactics, and does not continue trumps.</p>

<p>At Trick 7, Y plays properly in attempting to force the
strong trump hand, keeping knave of hearts with which
to trump clubs. If B refuses the first force he wins two
or three by cards, as the cards happen to lie. But he
cannot place the diamonds, and probably his best play is
to trump.</p>

of those cards. Z draws this inference <em>at the time</em>. It will

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 6).&mdash;The policy of this lead is doubtful.
Players are apt to show their suits in this manner. But it
is clear, the opponents having led diamonds and clubs,
that if Z has strength in any suit it is in spades. The
objections to showing a suit in this way are: 1, that it
may be trumped the first round; 2, that partner may
have only one card of it. In the latter case he cannot
return the lead, and must open or continue another suit
to a disadvantage.</p>

</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 9).&mdash;Z's play in not finessing is very good.
He can count Y's hand, thus: Y has no more clubs (<em>see</em>
Remark, Trick 3), he has the last trump, and three other
cards. These cards must either be queen, ten of spades,
and a diamond, in which case Z's play does not matter; or
the nine returned by Y must be his best spade, in which
case he can only have one more, as he would return the
higher of two remaining cards (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_79">79</a>), and his other
cards must then be two diamonds. Therefore, assuming
the case in which Z's play does matter (<em>i.e.</em>, of Y's nine
being his best spade), Y's diamond must be guarded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>Consequently, Z, by not finessing, makes sure of the
game. He requires one more trick besides the ace of
spades and his partner's trump, and this trick Y is certain
to make in diamonds if Z leads through A's hand (<em>see</em>
Remark, Trick 1).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

however A plays,</p>

<p>As the cards happen to lie, YZ only score four if Z
finesses at Trick 9, and A plays properly. A, on winning
this trick with the queen of spades, should see that his
only chance of making two more tricks is to be led up to
in diamonds. He should therefore (Trick 10) lead the
seven of diamonds, which Y is compelled to take, and AB
save the game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 5).&mdash;Z underplays in trumps. To continue
hearts, with queen, king marked against him (<em>see</em>
Trick 2), or to open diamonds, would be very disadvantageous,
so a trump lead is forced, more especially as Y has
command of clubs, and B is about to trump that suit. The
lead of ace or king of trumps would leave the lead with
Z, who would then still be in a difficulty as to his next
lead. Further, it is of importance to endeavour to place
the lead in Y's hand, that he may continue clubs. Also, if
the underplay succeeds, it is not at all unlikely that YZ
will win the game.</p>

<p>At Trick 5, if A puts on queen of spades, second hand,
he saves the game. May be, a very shrewd player would
have seen through the position, including the importance
of preventing Y from getting the lead if possible; but A
can hardly be blamed for passing, as it is unlikely that
both ace and king of spades are in Z's hand.</p>

<p>A and B both play the hand badly. At Trick 6, A, in
the face of an adverse trump lead and the command of his
suit (clubs) against him, should lead the ace of diamonds
to make the third trick and save the game. At Trick 8, B
should put on his queen of hearts. He is fairly taken in
by Y's dark play at Trick 6; but he ought not to have
allowed himself to be so. He should have argued that Y,
who has been playing a very strong game, would not be
likely to put on ace second hand merely for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of getting the lead or of making sure of a trick. Further,
if A's lead was a forced one, from weakness (hearts being
the only suit in which B can be strong), Z is sure to finesse
if he has king, knave, or even king, nine. So B's best
chance of making the queen is to put it on (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_102">102</a>).</p>

<p>It may be observed that Z loses the game by bad play at
Trick 7. The fall of the cards in Tricks 5 and 6 shows
that A has the queen of hearts, and Y the king. Z should
therefore, at Trick 7, lead the ace of spades to make the
fourth trick, and then the heart, making the fifth trick
and saving the game.</p>

<p>At Trick 8, if Y leads a spade and Z does not finesse, the
game may be saved. To finesse at that point would be
very bad play, as the ace of spades makes the fifth trick.
But Y's play at Trick 8, though unfortunate, is not wrong;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
for Y cannot tell that Z has the ace of spades; indeed, the
presumption is that he has not, or he would have led it.
Y properly plays to force the long trump, and to make
his partner fourth player.</p>

<p>Y should play queen of clubs at Trick 7, and ace of clubs
at Trick 9, when A will not have sufficient materials for
his <em>coup</em>, as he will be uncertain as to the position of the
best club. Y gives his adversary too much information
by playing book (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_113">113</a>). When the adversaries have
command of trumps, it is often advisable, towards the
end of a hand, to play so as not to enable them to count
the cards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 6).-A does not overtrump. This is
the sort of <em>coup</em> for which no rule can be laid down in
a book, as it depends entirely on the state of the game
and the previous fall of the cards. A sees, that his only
chance of two by cards is for the remaining trumps to be
divided, and for him to be able to get two rounds before
he loses the command of hearts. If then his partner has
ace, queen of spades, he may win the game against two
by honours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 10).&mdash;Y's play in not overtrumping is
very good. He counts the hand thus: to save the game Z
must hold ace, queen, or ace, knave of spades; his third
card is evidently the remaining diamond. A has the nine
of clubs (<em>see</em> fall of the club suit in Tricks 2, 7, and 9), and
two trumps. B has two trumps, one being queen or knave
(<em>see</em> Trick 9), and king, knave of clubs. If the cards
remaining in each hand are placed face upwards on the
table, and the uncertain cards, viz., the nine, four, and
three of trumps are given two to A, and one to B, it will
be seen that, if Y overtrumps with the seven, he cannot
make the requisite three tricks; but that, if he leaves the
lead with A, YZ make the remaining tricks.</p>

<p>It may be added, that if, at Trick 10, A discards his club,
and keeps his three little trumps together, leaving the trick
to B, AB must win the odd trick if B leads a trump at
Trick 11 after trumping. This A might have reckoned.</p>

<p>The end play of this hand is difficult. At Trick 9, Y
leads three of hearts in preference to the queen, as he can
count an honour single in A's hand. At Trick 10, A's
best lead is doubtful. At Trick 10, also, probably Y
should trump with the queen (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_147">147</a>); but even then,
B must place ten of hearts in Y's hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 7).&mdash;This is strong illustration of a
case for departing from rule. Y can count two more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
trumps, and three more spades in A's hand (<em>see</em> A's leads,
Tricks 3 and 6, and p. <a href="#Page_116">116</a>). It is clear that A can have
at most two hearts; consequently, if Y leads his tierce
major in hearts, he must lose the game, as the opponents
have two by honours. But, if Y can give his partner the
lead, and Z has four more clubs, or the winning club, and
A makes the mistake of trumping it, YZ may make every
trick, and win the game.</p>

<p>Y would be right to play as he does even if A had led
from only four spades. With a strong trump hand declared
against, and a long weak suit, it is doubtful whether A
should not have led the deuce of spades at Trick 3 (<em>see</em>
Appendix A); but the hand is given as it was played.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark.</span>&mdash;By the first
discard Z shows his strong
suit to be spades. In an
ordinary hand, Z might
afterwards throw a diamond.
But here, Y must
be strong in diamonds, in
order to save the game;
and it is important for Z
to keep the power of leading
that suit more than
once.</p>

honour, because the lead
was from weakness. B
plays badly; he should
have passed the knave.
For, A has shown four
more trumps, and only one
other trick is required.
Hence, if A has ace or
king of spades, the game is
won to a moral certainty;
if not, no good is got by
covering.</p>

<p>A plays well throughout, but he cannot prevent the
result. His lead of the trump at Trick 3 to show his
strength, and to tell his partner to make one trick
certain if he has the chance, is unlucky, as it puts the
adversaries on the only tack for saving the game.</p>

B therefore leads the king of hearts (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_142">142</a>). If he
makes the usual lead of a small heart, he wins a trick less
as the cards happen to lie.</p>

<p>At Trick 4, A having already shown his suit does not
discard from it, as there is still a possibility of bringing
it in (<em>see</em> pp. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>-6), and his king of clubs is sufficiently
protected even after the discard.</p>

<p>If Z parts with the last trump at Trick 6, and leads
diamonds, A, on the second round of diamonds, will
unguard his king of clubs, knowing his partner to have
a heart to lead him (<em>see</em> fall of the heart suit, Tricks
1, 4, and 5), will bring in all the hearts, and win the
odd trick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 7).&mdash;B refuses to win this trick. The
three of clubs is clearly in Z's hand (<em>see</em> fall of the club
suit, Tricks 5 and 7), and the two long trumps. The
remaining clubs are evidently in Y's hand. If, therefore,
B parts with the ace of clubs while Z has a club to lead,
AB lose the game, unless A has the king of spades; and if
A has that card, B loses nothing by passing this trick, as
Z, having only one more club, must hold three spades.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 8).&mdash;Well played by A. He sees that if
he obtains the lead on the second round of diamonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
he must continue the spade suit, a course demonstrably
fatal to him, unless his partner has the queen of diamonds
together with the long hearts (<em>see</em> fall of hearts, Trick 7).
By throwing the king to the ace A avoids the lead, and
saves the game if his partner has either queen or knave of
diamonds (as may be seen by placing the cards), unless
the adversaries continue the spade suit, when the game
cannot be saved, by any course of play. This clever <em>coup</em>
occurred in actual play.</p>

hearts to save the game. The last trump and best
diamond are against him. It is clear, therefore, if A
has the lead after the second round of hearts (when he
must lead a diamond), he loses the game. It is also
clear that unless B has king, knave, and a small heart,
the game is gone.</p>

<p>At Trick 2, Y is in difficulties. His strong suit has
been led by his right-hand adversary. Under these circumstances,
he leads from his strongest weak suit.</p>

<p>At Trick 6, Y's play in continuing the trump is open to
criticism. His better lead seems to be knave of diamonds.
Z wins his partner's ten of trumps in order to draw all the
trumps. It is very bad play, for if Z passes the ten, and
Y leads the knave of diamonds, the game is certain. This
is an example of the very common error of winning partner's
trick. It should seldom be done, and only if a
positive advantage can be well-nigh demonstrated from
doing it.</p>

<p>At Trick 11, the advantage of winning partner's trick&mdash;when
judiciously done&mdash;is shown. B, seeing A's anxiety
to get rid of the lead, rightly conjectures that A has two
more diamonds. He therefore takes the only course to
save the game, by winning his partner's queen of hearts.</p>

(Trick 10) leads queen of
diamonds, which analysis
shows is rather better than
a club, though, as the cards
happen to lie, his lead is
immaterial. Y trumps the
diamond, and</p>

<p class="center">YZ score three by cards and two by honours.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But for the echo, the game might have been missed. If
after being forced a second time, at Trick 5, Y deems it
prudent not to continue trumps, and leads two rounds of
diamonds, B makes a small trump, and the game is saved.</p>

his partner's hand, viz., the eight of trumps (<em>see</em> Remark,
Trick 4, and the fall of the hearts, Tricks 3, 4, and 5), the
last club, and a losing spade, as Z having put on the ace
of spades (Trick 9), cannot have the king. Y therefore
trumps with the nine, and (Trick 11) leads the seven of
hearts to put the lead in Z's hand. Z (Trick 12) leads the
club, to which Y discards the ten of spades; and</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 9).&mdash;B can now lead ace of diamonds, without
fear of its being trumped (<em>see</em> Remark, Trick 8). If the
position of the other trump were uncertain, the lead of the
ace of diamonds would be wrong. For, by leading nine
of trumps, B can make certain of saving the game (<em>see</em>
score); whereas, if Z has a trump, and trumps the ace
of diamonds, B loses the game, as Y will then make a
diamond.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> (Trick 9).&mdash;Well played by Y. He can count
B's hand as follows: ten and two small diamonds; queen
of spades (<em>see</em> Trick 6&mdash;the lead of the king could only be
from king, queen); and one other card, probably a small
spade, for had B another heart he would most likely have
continued his partner's original lead, instead of changing
the suit. Y now leads a trump in hopes that B will
discard the small spade, when Y will lead the seven of
spades to throw the lead into B's hand, and B will be
obliged to lead a diamond up to Y's tenace.</p>

<p>B, however, discards a diamond. Y continues his tactics
(<em>see</em> Trick 10), leading another trump. This compels
another discard from B. If B discards the small spade,
Y leads the losing spade; if B discards another diamond,
Y establishes the diamonds, and in either case wins the
game. This fine <em>coup</em> occurred in actual play.</p>

<p>At Trick 10, B should notice that he must lose the game
if he retains the queen of spades. His only chance of
saving the game here is to discard the queen of spades, in
hopes of finding his partner with two tricks in spades, or
with a trick in spades and hearts. If A has not these
cards, the game is lost.</p>

in Y's hand. Y must therefore have three trumps and
two spades. If B discards a spade to this trick, he cannot
avoid leading trumps twice up to Y. In that case Y will
make two tricks in trumps, saving the game, as will be
apparent by so playing the cards. The result is otherwise
if B trumps his partner's best heart. He can then lead
out ace and king of spades, to which Y must follow suit;
and by continuing with the five of clubs (the nine, eight,
and three are in against him), B secures the tenace, and
wins the game.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX A.<br />

AMERICAN LEADS.</h2>


<p>Since the appearance of the previous Edition of this
work, American Leads have been the subject of much
discussion.</p>

<p>American Leads propose a systematic course of
play when opening and continuing the lead from the
strong suit, as follows:&mdash;</p>


<h3>LOW CARD LED.</h3>

<p><em>When you open a strong suit with a</em> <span class="smcap">LOW CARD</span> <em>lead
your</em> <span class="smcap">FOURTH-BEST</span>.</p>

<p>When a four-card suit is opened with a low card,
the <em>lowest</em> is the card selected. Instead of calling
this the lowest, call it the <em>fourth-best</em>.</p>

<p>When a five-card suit is opened with a low card,
the <em>penultimate</em> card is selected. Instead of calling
this the penultimate, call it the <em>fourth-best</em>.</p>

<p>When a six-card suit is opened with a low card,
lead the <em>ante-penultimate</em>. Instead of calling this the
<em>ante-penultimate</em>, call it the <em>fourth-best</em>.</p>

<p>And so on for suits of more than six cards. Every
suit of four or more cards, opened with a low card, is
to be treated, on the first lead, as though there were
no cards below the fourth-best in the leader's hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="LOW CARD LED">
  <tr>
    <td></td>

<p>By following this method, you show your partner, as
regards a strong suit which you open with a low card,
that you <em>invariably</em> hold <em>exactly three</em> cards higher
than the one first led; and not infrequently what
those cards are.</p>


<h3>HIGH CARD LED FOLLOWED BY LOW CARD.</h3>

<p><em>When you open a strong suit with a</em> <span class="smcap">HIGH CARD</span>,
<em>and next lead a</em> <span class="smcap">LOW CARD</span>, <em>lead your</em> <span class="smcap">ORIGINAL
FOURTH-BEST</span>.</p>

<p>When ace is led from ace and four or more small
cards, after leading the ace, lead the original fourth-best,
<em>i.e.</em>, the card you would have led if opening
with a small card. Thus, in trumps, with ace, knave,
nine, eight, seven, an advanced player would begin
the eight. In plain suits, the ace would be first led.
The second lead of an American Leader would be the
eight, the original fourth-best, and not the seven.</p>

<p>By following this method, you inform your partner
that you <em>invariably</em> remain with <em>exactly two</em> cards
higher than the second card led, as shown by the
following tabulated example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p>By leading in this way you not infrequently tell
your partner what your remaining high cards are.
Thus, with the above combination, if king, queen
come out on the second round, and your partner holds
the ten, he knows to a certainty that you command
the suit, a fact about which he would have been in
doubt had you continued with the lowest.</p>

<p>The same rule, when a high card is followed by a
low card, applies to king led from king, queen, and
small ones, when the king wins the trick; and to ten,
led from king, knave, ten and one or more small ones,
when the ten wins the trick. These are all the possible
cases. With king, knave, ten, nine, if the nine wins
the first trick, the leader goes on with a high card.</p>


<h3>HIGH CARD LED FOLLOWED BY HIGH CARD.</h3>

<p><em>When you remain with</em> <span class="smcap">TWO HIGH INDIFFERENT
CARDS</span>, <em>lead the</em> <span class="smcap">HIGHER</span> <em>if you opened a</em> <span class="smcap">SUIT OF
FOUR</span>; <span class="smcap">THE LOWER</span> <em>if you opened a</em> <span class="smcap">SUIT OF FIVE</span> <em>or
more</em>. (<em>See</em> Analysis of Leads in Detail, p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>).</p>

<p>The typical example is the combination of ace,
queen, knave, and one or more small cards. With
four in suit, ace, then queen is led. But with more
than four in suit, the knave is led after the ace,
because then, if your partner remains with king and
one small card, you are strong enough to invite him to
win your trick in order to unblock your long suit.</p>

<p>In the same way, if queen is led from queen,
knave, ten and small, you proceed with the knave,
holding only ten and one small. But, with knave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
ten and more than one small, you continue with the
ten, the lower of two indifferent high cards, to induce
your partner to win it, and so to unblock your suit,
should he remain with ace and one small one, or with
king and one small one.</p>

<p>Consequently, if your partner is an American
Leader, and on the second round of your suit, you lead
the higher of two high indifferent cards, he will count
your strong suit to have consisted of <em>four cards</em>
exactly. On the other hand, when on the second
round, you lead the lower of two high indifferent
cards, he will count <em>at least three</em> of your strong suit
still in your hand. As it is advantageous to your
partner to be able to count your hand in this way,
whether he has blocking cards or not, you should
always pursue the same system. Thus: you lead ten,
from king, knave, ten, &amp;c. The ten forces the queen.
You obtain the lead again. Your king, knave are now
high indifferent cards. If you lead the king, your
partner knows you remain with knave and at most one
small card of the suit. If you lead the knave, your
partner knows you remain with king and at least two
small ones.</p>

<p>Or, you lead knave, from king, queen, knave, and two
or more small ones. On leading the suit again, if you
continue with king, your partner counts queen, and
exactly two small ones in your hand. If you continue
with queen, your partner counts king and more than
two small ones in your hand (<em>see</em> p. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>).</p>

<p>Before deciding which of two or more high cards to
lead, be sure whether they are <em>indifferent</em> cards. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
information you can obtain by consulting the Analysis
of Leads (p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>). When, in the Analysis, the second
lead is given without any qualification, the high cards
are not indifferent.</p>

<p>Three objections are urged against American Leads
by players who oppose their adoption. The first is,</p>


<h3><em>That they complicate the game.</em></h3>

<p>Even were this stricture true, it is no objection to
an intellectual game that it exercises the minds of the
players. But it has hardly any foundation in fact.
All an American Leader asks his partner to observe
is:&mdash;</p>

<p>That, when he originally leads a low card he holds
three of the suit higher than the card led.</p>

<p>That, when he originally leads a high card and next
a low one, he still holds two cards higher than the
second card led. And,</p>

<p>That, when he originally leads a high card, and
follows it with a high card, he indicates, in many
cases, to any one who knows the Analysis of Leads (as
every whist player ought), whether his strong suit
consisted of four or of more than four cards.</p>

<p>The second objection is,</p>


<h3><em>That they seldom affect the result.</em></h3>

<p>The answer is that American Leads add little which
is new to the game. They only consolidate the
received practice, and extend a law of uniformity to
cases not previously provided for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>The third objection is,</p>


<h3><em>That the information afforded may be of more use to the
opponents than to the leader's partner.</em></h3>

<p>No doubt it may. But, under other whist conditions,
experience tells us that it is advantageous, in the long
run, to convey information of strength, notwithstanding
its publication to the whole table. It is in the highest
degree improbable that a player will be at a disadvantage
by imparting too much information.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that American Leads,
in their integrity, assume not merely <em>an</em> original lead,
but <em>the</em> original lead of the hand,&mdash;the very first lead
of all. When a player obtains the lead, for the first
time, after one or more tricks have been played, he
may open his strong suit in the same way as though
he were <em>the</em> original leader. On the other hand, he
may deem it advisable to open a weak suit; or to
lead through a strong one, or up to a weak one; or, if
great strength in trumps has been declared against him,
may wish to conceal the fact that his best suit is only
a very long one of small cards (<em>see</em> Hand IX, Tricks 6
and 7); or, if late in the hand, he may conclude that
the time for precise exhibition of strength is past and
gone (<em>see</em> Hand XIII, Tricks 8 and 9, and Hand
XXIV, Tricks 5 and 6). These, however, are matters
of judgment, for which no hard and fast rule can be
laid down.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX B.<br />

THE PLAIN-SUIT ECHO.</h2>


<p>All whist players are aware that it is advisable to
get rid of the command of their partner's long suit.
But no general rules have been laid down to further
this end. It has been left, for the most part, to the
ingenuity of the individual to decide for himself, on
the spur of the moment, how and when unblocking
should be attempted.</p>

<p>Assuming an original lead of a high card from a
plain suit of four or more cards, the third hand may
think fit to win his partner's trick in order to free the
suit. With regard to knave led, the play of the third
hand, holding ace, &amp;c., is well known. And there
are other cases, such as the play of the third hand,
holding ace, knave only, when king is led originally;
but these are too elementary for discussion here.</p>

<p>If the third hand does not endeavour to win the
first trick in his partner's suit, he is instructed to
play his lowest card. This is, no doubt, sound,
except where the third hand holds four cards exactly
of his partner's suit, and he may block it should the
lead have been from more than four cards. Then he
should sometimes retain in his hand the lowest of his
four cards, and play the next higher one. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
object of the Plain-Suit Echo to determine the cases,
in which this play is advisable.</p>

<p>The typical example is that of ace led originally by
a strong suit player. The second hand follows suit.
The third hand holds king, queen, knave, deuce of
the suit. The lead was from at least five cards. If
the third hand is not to block his partner's suit, he
must play the knave to the ace. If the fourth hand
follows suit, it is impossible to lose by playing as
above proposed; and, even if the fourth hand
renounces, it is only possible to lose when the lead
was from five cards exactly, and the four cards
accompanying the ace are all very small ones.</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;The original leader (a strong suit player),
leads queen of a plain suit.</p>

<p>The third hand holds nine, eight, seven and a very
small one. He may block the suit by playing the

ten, he cannot possibly lose by playing the seven to
the queen; and, if the lead was from more than four
cards he may gain.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX C.<br />

ON THE ORIGINAL LEAD OF KING.</h2>


<p>The Analysis of Leads, undertaken in order to ascertain
the cases in which the third hand should unblock his
partner's suit, showed that king led originally conveys
less information to partner than the lead of any other
high card. It is the only case in which the lead of a
high card is made without at least five in suit, or
without the accompaniment of at least two other high
cards.</p>

<p>Hence the student was told<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> that when a king is led
originally, he must not attempt to unblock the suit on
the first round; and this recommendation is quite
sound.</p>

<p>It seemed strange that when ace, queen, knave,
or ten is led originally, the third hand, with four
exactly in suit, should retain his lowest card for
two rounds; but that, when king is led, he should
abandon these tactics. The conclusion forced on
the Author was, that king should never be led
originally, when the leader desires to invite his
partner to unblock.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>
<p>The cases where the leader desires his partner to
unblock, are those in which the original lead is from
more than four cards, the third hand at the same time
holding four of the suit exactly, as explained in
Appendix B, p. <a href="#Page_287">287</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, the argument on the previous pages
being admitted, king should never be led originally
from a suit of more than four cards; and it almost
follows that king should always be led from a suit of
four cards exactly, which contains an ace, king, or a
king, queen combination.</p>


<h3><em>Ace, king, queen, knave, and one or more small.</em></h3>

<p>Lead knave, in all suits.</p>

<p>Holding more than two small, follow knave with
queen; holding two small, follow knave with king;
holding one small, follow knave with ace.</p>


<h3><em>Ace, king, queen, knave, only.</em></h3>

<p>Lead king, then knave, in all suits.</p>

<p>Ace, queen, exactly, are marked in the leader's hand.</p>


<h3><em>Ace, king, queen, and more than one small.</em></h3>

<p>Lead queen, in all suits.</p>

<p>Holding more than two small, follow queen with
king; holding two small, follow queen with ace.</p>


<h3><em>Ace, king, queen, and one small.</em></h3>

<p>Lead king, then queen, in all suits.</p>

<p>Ace and at most one small, are marked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>Ace, king, and more than two small.</em></h3>

<p>Lead ace, then king, in plain suits.</p>

<p>In trumps the same, holding seven trumps; with
less than seven trumps, lead fourth best.</p>


<h3><em>Ace, king, and two small.</em></h3>

<p>Lead king in plain suits; the smallest in trumps.</p>


<h3><em>King, queen, knave, ten, and small (including the nine).</em></h3>

<p>Lead ten in all suits.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<em>a</em>). If ten wins the trick:&mdash;</p>

<p>Holding more than two small, follow ten with
knave; holding two small, follow ten with queen;
holding one small, follow ten with king.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<em>b</em>). If ten forces ace:&mdash;</p>

<p>Holding more than one small, follow ten with
knave; holding one small, follow ten with queen.</p>

<p>In case <em>b</em>, ten cannot be followed with king, as
then partner would be doubtful as to the position of
the queen.</p>


<h3><em>King, queen, knave, ten, only.</em></h3>

<p>Lead king, then ten, in all suits.</p>

<p>Queen, knave, exactly, are marked in the leader's
hand.</p>

<p>Here the leader runs the risk, in plain suits, of
being blocked if his partner holds ace, and one small
one, originally. There is a conflict of advantages and
disadvantages; in favour, the Author believes, of the
lead of king, if the suit contains only four cards
(<em>compare</em> p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>, bearing in mind that, when that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
written, the lead of any card rather than a king, from
suits of more than four cards, had not been the
subject of consideration).</p>


<h3><em>King, queen, knave, more than one small.</em></h3>

<p>Lead knave, in all suits.</p>

<p>Holding more than two small, follow knave with
queen; holding two small, follow knave with king.</p>


<h3><em>King, queen, knave, one small.</em></h3>

<p>Lead king, then knave, in all suits.</p>

<p>If king forces ace, or if partner holds ace, the leader,
on the appearance of the knave, is marked with queen
and one small. If ace is not forced, the presumption
is that the leader remains with ace, queen, exactly
(<em>see</em> lead from ace, king, queen, knave).</p>


<h3><em>King, queen, ten, and more than one small, in trumps.</em></h3>

<p>Lead queen.</p>

<p>If queen wins the trick, follow with fourth best
<em>remaining in hand</em>. King is marked; so, exclude the
king, and on second lead continue with the fourth
best of the small cards.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, the leader will be marked with at
least five trumps originally, including king, ten; or,
if he has not the ten, with at least seven trumps
originally.</p>

<p>If queen forces ace, on the appearance of the king,
the leader is marked with at least five trumps originally
(one being the ten); or, if he has not the ten, with at
least seven trumps originally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>King, queen, ten, and one small, in trumps.</em></h3>

<p>Lead king.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, the leader will be marked with
exactly four trumps originally, including queen, ten.</p>


<h3><em>King, queen, and more than two small.</em></h3>

<p>Lead queen.</p>

<p>If queen wins the trick, follow with fourth best
remaining in hand (<em>compare</em>, lead from king, queen,
ten, and more than one small, in trumps).</p>

<p>If queen forces ace, on the appearance of the king,
the leader is marked with more than four originally.</p>

<p>In trumps, the same, holding seven trumps; with
less than seven trumps, lead fourth best.</p>


<h3><em>King, queen, two small.</em></h3>

<p>Lead king, in plain suits.</p>

<p>On the appearance of the ace, the leader is marked
with queen and at most two small.</p>

<p>In trumps, lead lowest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Granted that the third player will not trump an
honour led originally (and he will seldom lose by
passing, even if weak in trumps), the foregoing leads
are clearly advantageous, as they enable the third
player to employ the unblocking system, and assist
him in counting his partner's hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The mode of leading, here set forth, has been tried
by a number of good players, and has been generally
approved. It is, therefore, strongly recommended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the consideration of advanced players, assuming
always that the leader's partner is himself an advanced
player. Notwithstanding the strong opinion
in its favour entertained by the Author, it is still
retained in an Appendix, that it may be tested by
further trial before being positively asserted as a
substantive part of the game.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
